        "Preface": "Originally I wrote Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in the form in which it is\npresented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript\nwas, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and\nwithout explanations for most of the original verses of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä. In all of my other books—Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Éçopaniñad,\netc.—the system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration,\nword-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This\nmakes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning\nself-evident. I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my\noriginal manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gétä As It Is\nconsiderably increased, I was requested by many scholars and devotees to\npresent the book in its original form. Thus the present attempt is to offer the\noriginal manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full paramparä\nexplanation in order to establish the Kåñëa consciousness movement more\nsoundly and progressively.\nOur Kåñëa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized,\nnatural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is. It\nis gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world,\nespecially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more\ninteresting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming\ninterested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are\nencouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the\nInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers\nand mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for\nmy leading the Kåñëa consciousness movement throughout the entire world.\nSome of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have\nstarted the Kåñëa consciousness movement in America. But actually the.\noriginal father of this movement is Lord Kåñëa Himself, since it was started a\nvery long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic\nsuccession. If I have any credit in this connection, it does not belong to me\npersonally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Oà\nViñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta\nSarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja Prabhupäda.\nIf personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried to\npresent Bhagavad-gétä as it is, without any adulteration. Before my\npresentation of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, almost all the English editions of\nBhagavad-gétä were introduced to fulfill someone’s personal ambition. But our\nattempt, in presenting Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, is to present the mission of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Our business is to present the will of\nKåñëa, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or\nscientist, for they have very little knowledge of Kåñëa, despite all their other\nknowledge. When Kåñëa says, man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà\nnamaskuru [Bg. 18.65], etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that\nKåñëa and His inner spirit are different. Kåñëa is absolute, and there is no\ndifference between Kåñëa’s name, Kåñëa’s form, Kåñëa’s qualities, Kåñëa’s\npastimes, etc. This absolute position of Kåñëa is difficult to understand for any\nperson who is not a devotee of Kåñëa in the system of paramparä (disciplic\nsuccession). Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers, and\nsvämés, without perfect knowledge of Kåñëa, try to banish or kill Kåñëa when\nwriting commentary on Bhagavad-gétä. Such unauthorized commentary upon\nBhagavad-gétä is known as Mäyäväda-bhäñya, and Lord Caitanya has warned us\nabout these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone who\ntries to understand Bhagavad-gétä from the Mäyävädé point of view will\ncommit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that the misguided\nstudent of Bhagavad-gétä will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual\nguidance and will not be able to go back to home, back to Godhead.\nOur only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in order to guide\nthe conditioned student to the same purpose for which Kåñëa descends to this\nplanet once in a day of Brahmä, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is\nstated in Bhagavad-gétä, and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no.\npoint in trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä and its speaker, Lord Kåñëa.\nLord Kåñëa first spoke Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god some hundreds of millions\nof years ago. We have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical\nsignificance of Bhagavad-gétä, without misinterpretation, on the authority of\nKåñëa. To interpret Bhagavad-gétä without any reference to the will of Kåñëa is\nthe greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense, one has to\nunderstand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was\ndirectly understood by Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa’s first disciple. Such understanding\nof Bhagavad-gétä is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human\nsociety in fulfilling the mission of life.\nThe Kåñëa consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it\noffers the highest perfection of life. How this is so is explained fully in the\nBhagavad-gétä. Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of\nBhagavad-gétä to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people\nregarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should\nknow how God, or Kåñëa, is great, and everyone should know the factual\nposition of the living entities. Everyone should know that a living entity is\neternally a servant and that unless one serves Kåñëa one has to serve illusion\nin different varieties of the three modes of material nature and thus wander\nperpetually within the cycle of birth and death; even the so-called liberated\nMäyävädé speculator has to undergo this process. This knowledge constitutes a\ngreat science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own\ninterest.\nPeople in general, especially in this Age of Kali, are enamored by the\nexternal energy of Kåñëa, and they wrongly think that by advancement of\nmaterial comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the\nmaterial or external nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly bound by\nthe stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and\nparcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service\nto the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his\npersonal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him\nhappy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy\nthe senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants.\nthis, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of\nBhagavad-gétä. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching the whole\nworld this central point, and because we are not polluting the theme of\nBhagavad-gétä As It Is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by\nstudying the Bhagavad-gétä must take help from the Kåñëa consciousness\nmovement for practical understanding of Bhagavad-gétä under the direct\nguidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest\nbenefit by studying Bhagavad-gétä As It Is as we have presented it here, and if\neven one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our\nattempt a success.\nA.

It is the essence of Vedic\nknowledge and one of the most important Upaniñads in Vedic literature. Of\ncourse there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gétä, and one\nmay question the necessity for another one. This present edition can be\nexplained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to\nrecommend an English translation of Bhagavad-gétä. Of course in America\nthere are so many editions of Bhagavad-gétä available in English, but as far as I\nhave seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly\nsaid to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator\nhas expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gétä as\nit is.\nThe spirit of Bhagavad-gétä is mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä itself. It is just\nlike this: If we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the\ndirections written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our\nown whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the\ndirections on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly,\nBhagavad-gétä should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker\nHimself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gétä is Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is mentioned on.\nevery page of Bhagavad-gétä as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nBhagavän. Of course the word bhagavän sometimes refers to any powerful\nperson or any powerful demigod, and certainly here bhagavän designates Lord\nÇré Kåñëa as a great personality, but at the same time we should know that\nLord Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all\ngreat äcäryas (spiritual masters) like Çaìkaräcärya, Rämänujäcärya,\nMadhväcärya, Nimbärka Svämé, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and many other\nauthorities of Vedic knowledge in India. The Lord Himself also establishes\nHimself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gétä, and He\nis accepted as such in the Brahma-saàhitä and all the Puräëas, especially the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam, known as the Bhägavata Puräëa (kåñëas tu bhagavän\nsvayam). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-gétä as it is directed by the\nPersonality of Godhead Himself. In the Fourth Chapter of the Gétä (4.1–3) the\nLord says:\nimaà vivasvate yogaà\nproktavän aham avyayam\nvivasvän manave präha\nmanur ikñväkave ’bravét\n [Bg. 4.1]\nevaà paramparä-präptam\nimaà räjarñayo viduù\nsa käleneha mahatä\nyogo nañöaù parantapa\n[Bg. 4.2]\nsa eväyaà mayä te ’dya\nyogaù proktaù purätanaù\nbhakto ’si me sakhä ceti\nrahasyaà hy etad uttamam\n[Bg. 4.3]\nHere the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga, the Bhagavad-gétä,\nwas first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, and.\nManu explained it to Ikñväku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one\nspeaker after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the\ncourse of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again,\nthis time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.\nHe tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because\nArjuna is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä\nis a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are\nthree classes of transcendentalists, namely the jïäné, the yogé and the bhakta,\nor the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells\nArjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparä (disciplic\nsuccession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish,\ntherefore, to establish another paramparä in the same line of thought that was\ncoming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching\nbe distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in\nunderstanding the Bhagavad-gétä. So we see that Bhagavad-gétä is instructed to\nArjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student\nof Kåñëa, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gétä is best understood\nby a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a\ndevotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a\ndevotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a\nvery elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a\nrelationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different\nways:\n1. One may be a devotee in a passive state;\n2. One may be a devotee in an active state;\n3. One may be a devotee as a friend;\n4. One may be a devotee as a parent;\n5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.\nArjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a\ngulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the\nmaterial world. This is transcendental friendship, which cannot be had by\neveryone. Of course everyone has a particular relationship with the Lord, and.\nthat relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service. But in the\npresent status of our life, not only have we forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we\nhave forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord. Every living being, out\nof the many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular\nrelationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svarüpa. By the process of\ndevotional service, one can revive that svarüpa, and that stage is called\nsvarüpa-siddhi —perfection of one’s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a\ndevotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.\nHow Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gétä should be noted. His manner of\nacceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter (10.12–14):\narjuna uväca\nparaà brahma paraà dhäma\npavitraà paramaà bhavän\npuruñaà çäçvataà divyam\nädi-devam ajaà vibhum\nähus tväm åñayaù sarve\ndevarñir näradas tathä\nasito devalo vyäsaù\nsvayaà caiva bravéñi me\nsarvam etad åtaà manye\nyan mäà vadasi keçava\nna hi te bhagavan vyaktià\nvidur devä na dänaväù\n“Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate\nabode, the purest, the Absolute Truth. You are the eternal, transcendental,\noriginal person, the unborn, the greatest. All the great sages such as Närada,\nAsita, Devala, and Vyäsa confirm this truth about You, and now You Yourself\nare declaring it to me. O Kåñëa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told\nme. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your\npersonality.”",
        "Introduction p2": "After hearing Bhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,.\nArjuna accepted Kåñëa as paraà brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every living\nbeing is Brahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Paraà dhäma means that He is the\nsupreme rest or abode of everything; pavitram means that He is pure, untainted\nby material contamination; puruñam means that He is the supreme enjoyer;\nçäçvatam, original; divyam, transcendental; ädi-devam, the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead; ajam, the unborn; and vibhum, the greatest.\nNow one may think that because Kåñëa was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna\nwas telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this\nkind of doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad-gétä, substantiates\nthese praises in the next verse when he says that Kåñëa is accepted as the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead not only by himself but by authorities like\nNärada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsadeva. These are great personalities who\ndistribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all äcäryas. Therefore\nArjuna tells Kåñëa that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect.\nSarvam etad åtaà manye: “I accept everything You say to be true.” Arjuna also\nsays that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He\ncannot be known even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord\ncannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how\ncan a human being understand Lord Çré Kåñëa without becoming His devotee?\nTherefore Bhagavad-gétä should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One\nshould not think that he is equal to Kåñëa, nor should he think that Kåñëa is\nan ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. So according to the statements of\nBhagavad-gétä or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is trying to\nunderstand the Bhagavad-gétä, we should at least theoretically accept Çré Kåñëa\nas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with that submissive spirit we can\nunderstand the Bhagavad-gétä. Unless one reads the Bhagavad-gétä in a\nsubmissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand Bhagavad-gétä, because it is a\ngreat mystery.\nJust what is the Bhagavad-gétä? The purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to deliver\nmankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty\nin so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle.\nof Kurukñetra. Arjuna surrendered unto Çré Kåñëa, and consequently this\nBhagavad-gétä was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of\nanxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the\natmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by\nnonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into\nasat. Asat refers to that which does not exist.\nOut of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are\nactually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put\ninto this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position\nof questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering\nbut rather wants to make a solution to all suffering, then one is not to be\nconsidered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry\nis awakened in one’s mind. In the Brahma-sütra this inquiry is called brahma\njijïäsä. Athäto brahma jijïäsä. Every activity of the human being is to be\nconsidered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute.\nTherefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they\ncame from and where they shall go after death are proper students for\nunderstanding Bhagavad-gétä. The sincere student should also have a firm\nrespect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.\nLord Kåñëa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when\nman forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who\nawaken, there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his\nposition, and for him this Bhagavad-gétä is spoken. Actually we are all\nswallowed by the tigress of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living\nentities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gétä,\nmaking His friend Arjuna His student.\nBeing an associate of Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but\nArjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to\nquestion Lord Kåñëa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain\nthem for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the\nplan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human\nlife.\nThe subject of the Bhagavad-gétä entails the comprehension of five basic.\ntruths. First of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional\nposition of the living entities, jévas. There is éçvara, which means the\ncontroller, and there are jévas, the living entities which are controlled. If a\nliving entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane.\nThe living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life.\nSo in the Bhagavad-gétä the subject matter deals with the éçvara, the supreme\ncontroller, and the jévas, the controlled living entities. Prakåti (material\nnature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the\nmanifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed. The\ncosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are\nengaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä we must learn what God is,\nwhat the living entities are, what prakåti is, what the cosmic manifestation is,\nhow it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.\nOut of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä it is established that\nthe Supreme Godhead, or Kåñëa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or\nParamätmä—you may use whatever name you like—is the greatest of all. The\nliving beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord\nhas control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in\nthe later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä. Material nature is not independent. She is\nacting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kåñëa says,\nmayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram: “This material nature is working\nunder My direction.” When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic\nnature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a\ncontroller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish\nnot to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an\nautomobile is quite wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal\npulling it, but a sane man knows the nature of the automobile’s engineering\narrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a\ndriver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction\neverything is working. Now the jévas, or the living entities, have been accepted\nby the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A\nparticle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and\nsimilarly we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme.\ncontroller, éçvara, or Bhagavän, Lord Çré Kåñëa, have all the qualities of the\nSupreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute éçvaras, subordinate\néçvaras. We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control\nspace or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kåñëa.\nBut although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should\nknow that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in\nBhagavad-gétä.\nWhat is material nature? This is also explained in Gétä as inferior prakåti,\ninferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prakåti. Prakåti is\nalways under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti is female, and she is\ncontrolled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the\nhusband. Prakåti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the\npredominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated,\ncontrolled by the Supreme Lord. According to the Gétä, the living entities,\nalthough parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakåti.\nThis is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. Apareyam\nitas tv anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm/ jéva-bhütäm: “This material nature is\nMy inferior prakåti, but beyond this is another prakåti—jéva-bhütäm, the living\nentity.”\nMaterial nature itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of\ngoodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes\nthere is eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under\nthe control and purview of eternal time there are activities, which are called\nkarma. These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we\nare suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am\na businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed\na great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my\nmoney in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we\nenjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma.\nÉçvara (the Supreme Lord), jéva (the living entity), prakåti (nature), käla\n(eternal time) and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. Out\nof these five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal.\nThe manifestation of prakåti may be temporary, but it is not false. Some.\nphilosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but\naccording to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä or according to the philosophy of\nthe Vaiñëavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as\nfalse; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which\nmoves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes\ngrains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away,\nall the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material\nmanifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then\ndisappears. Such are the workings of prakåti. But this cycle is working\neternally. Therefore prakåti is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as\n“My prakåti.” This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme\nLord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord,\nalthough they are not separated but eternally related. So the Lord, the living\nentity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal.\nHowever, the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of karma may be\nvery old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from\ntime immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or our activity,\nand this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged\nin various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we\nshould adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities,\nbut this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gétä.\nThe position of éçvara, the Supreme Lord, is that of supreme consciousness.\nThe jévas, or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord,\nare also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as\nprakåti, the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jéva, is\nconscious. The other prakåti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore\nthe jéva-prakåti is called superior because the jéva has consciousness which is\nsimilar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supreme consciousness, however, and one\nshould not claim that the jéva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious.\nThe living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection,\nand the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be,\nbut he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.\nThe distinction between the jéva and the éçvara will be explained in the.\nThirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord is kñetra-jïa, conscious, as is\nthe living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body,\nwhereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of\nevery living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular\njévas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Paramätmä, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone’s heart as éçvara, as the\ncontroller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he\ndesires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a\ndetermination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the actions\nand reactions of his own karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters\nanother type of body, as we put on and take off clothes. As the soul thus\nmigrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These\nactivities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in\nsanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so,\nthen all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed.\nConsequently, karma is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items\n(éçvara, jéva, prakåti, time and karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not\neternal.",
        "Introduction p3": "The supreme conscious éçvara is similar to the living entity in this way: both\nthe consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental.\nIt is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a\nmistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain\ncircumstances of material combination is not accepted in the Bhagavad-gétä.\nConsciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material\ncircumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a\ncertain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected. Lord\nKåñëa says, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù [Bg. 9.10]. When He descends into the\nmaterial universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were so\naffected, He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in\nthe Bhagavad-gétä. One cannot say anything about the transcendental world\nwithout being free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is\nnot materially contaminated. Our consciousness, at the present moment,\nhowever, is materially contaminated. The Bhagavad-gétä teaches that we have.\nto purify this materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness,\nour actions will be dovetailed to the will of éçvara, and that will make us happy.\nIt is not that we have to cease all activities. Rather, our activities are to be\npurified, and purified activities are called bhakti. Activities in bhakti appear to\nbe like ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person\nmay see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a\nperson with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the\ndevotee or of the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or\nmatter. They are transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should\nknow, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.\nWhen we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned. False\nconsciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material\nnature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily\nconceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken to\nliberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this\nposition in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become\nfree from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the\ntranscendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become\nliberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti, or\nliberation, means freedom from material consciousness. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam also the definition of liberation is given. Muktir\nhitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù: mukti means liberation from the\ncontaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure\nconsciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä are intended to awaken\nthis pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the Gétä’s\ninstructions that Kåñëa is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified\nconsciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the\ninstructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified\nconsciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of\nthe Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior\nmodes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is the\ndifference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls.\nWhat is this consciousness? This consciousness is “I am.” Then what am I?.\nIn contaminated consciousness “I am” means “I am the lord of all I survey. I am\nthe enjoyer.” The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is\nthe lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two\npsychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the\nenjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer,\nand the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the\ncreator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed.\nFor instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of\nthe body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes, and so on are\nall parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the\nenjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of\nthe body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the\nprincipal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is\ngiven to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one\nnourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a\nhealthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach.\nSimilarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as\nsubordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This\ncooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all\nother parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take\nthe food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be\nfrustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme\nLord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The\nrelation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully\nsatisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be\nsatisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to\nenjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these\ntendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested\ncosmic world.\nWe shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-gétä that the complete whole is\ncomprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic\nmanifestation, eternal time and karma, or activities, and all of these are\nexplained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete whole,.\nand the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete\nwhole and the complete Absolute Truth are the complete Personality of\nGodhead, Çré Kåñëa. All manifestations are due to His different energies. He is\nthe complete whole.\nIt is also explained in the Gétä that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate\nto the complete Supreme Person (brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham). Brahman is more\nexplicitly explained in the Brahma-sütra to be like the rays of the sunshine.\nThe impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole,\nand so also is the conception of Paramätmä. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall\nbe seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruñottama, is above both\nimpersonal Brahman and the partial realization of Paramätmä. The Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is called sac-cid-änanda-vigraha. The Brahma-saàhitä\nbegins in this way: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/ anädir ädir\ngovindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam. “Govinda, Kåñëa, is the cause of all causes. He\nis the primal cause, and He is the very form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.”\nImpersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His sat (eternity) feature.\nParamätmä realization is the realization of sat-cit (eternal knowledge). But\nrealization of the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is realization of all the\ntranscendental features: sat, cit and änanda (eternity, knowledge, and bliss) in\ncomplete vigraha (form).\nPeople with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal,\nbut He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic\nliteratures. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm. (Kaöha Upaniñad 2.2.13) As we\nare all individual living beings and have our individuality, the Supreme\nAbsolute Truth is also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the\nPersonality of Godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features in\nHis complete form. The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if\nHe is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The\ncomplete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our\nexperience, otherwise it cannot be complete.\nThe complete whole, Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies\n(paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate). How Kåñëa is acting in different potencies is.\nalso explained in Bhagavad-gétä. This phenomenal world or material world in\nwhich we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements\nof which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to\nSäìkhya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete resources\nwhich are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe.\nThere is nothing extraneous, nor is there anything needed. This manifestation\nhas its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time\nis complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the\ncomplete arrangement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small\ncomplete units, namely the living entities, to realize the complete, and all sorts\nof incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the\ncomplete. So Bhagavad-gétä contains the complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.\nAll Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be\ncomplete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and\naccording to småti, or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal\nhe has to take a bath to purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is\nconsidered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be\ncontradictory, but it is accepted because it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by\naccepting this, one will not commit a mistake; subsequently it has been proved\nby modern science that cow dung contains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic\nknowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes, and\nBhagavad-gétä is the essence of all Vedic knowledge.\nVedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is\nimperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We have to\naccept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-gétä, by\nthe paramparä (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the\nproper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual\nmaster, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual\nmasters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Çré Kåñëa, accepts\neverything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to\naccept one portion of Bhagavad-gétä and not another. No. We must accept\nBhagavad-gétä without interpretation, without deletion and without our own\nwhimsical participation in the matter. The Gétä should be taken as the most.\nperfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from\ntranscendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself.\nThe words spoken by the Lord are called apauruñeya, meaning that they are\ndifferent from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected\nwith four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably\nillusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect\nsenses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information\nof all-pervading knowledge.\nVedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was\nimparted unto the heart of Brahmä, the first created living being, and Brahmä\nin his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he\noriginally received it from the Lord. The Lord is pürëam, all-perfect, and there\nis no possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One\nshould therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only\nproprietor of everything in the universe and that He is the original creator,\nthe creator of Brahmä. In the Eleventh Chapter the Lord is addressed as\nprapitämaha [Bg. 11.39] because Brahmä is addressed as pitämaha, the\ngrandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should claim\nto be the proprietor of anything; one should accept only things which are set\naside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance.\nThere are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which\nare set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä. In the\nbeginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of\nKurukñetra. This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not\npossible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This\ndecision was based on the body because he was thinking that the body was\nhimself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers, nephews,\nbrothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on. Therefore he wanted to satisfy his\nbodily demands. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by the Lord just to change this\nview, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord\nwhen he says, kariñye vacanaà tava [Bg. 18.73]: “I shall act according to Your\nword.”",
        "Introduction p4": "In this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs. Men.\nmust be intelligent to realize the importance of human life and refuse to act\nlike ordinary animals. A human being should realize the aim of his life, and\nthis direction is given in all Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in\nBhagavad-gétä. Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals.\nAnimals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their\npart, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste,\nhe must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gétä it\nis clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the\ndifferent modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of\nignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in\ngoodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we\nproperly utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä, then our whole life will\nbecome purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which\nis beyond this material sky. [Bg. 15.6]\nThat destination is called the sanätana sky, the eternal, spiritual sky. In this\nmaterial world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays\nfor some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is\nthe law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a\npiece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another\nworld of which we have information. That world consists of another nature,\nwhich is sanätana, eternal. Jéva is also described as sanätana, eternal, and the\nLord is also described as sanätana in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an\nintimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively\none—the sanätana-dhäma, or sky, the sanätana Supreme Personality and the\nsanätana living entities—the whole purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to revive our\nsanätana occupation, or sanätana-dharma, which is the eternal occupation of\nthe living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of\nthese activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities\nand take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is\ncalled our pure life.\nThe Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both sanätana, as are\nthe living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the\nliving entities in the sanätana abode is the perfection of human life. The Lord.\nis very kind to the living entities because they are His sons. Lord Kåñëa\ndeclares in Bhagavad-gétä, sarva-yoniñu. .. ahaà béja-pradaù pitä: “I am the\nfather of all.” Of course there are all types of living entities according to their\nvarious karmas, but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them.\nTherefore the Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls, to\ncall them back to the sanätana eternal sky so that the sanätana living entities\nmay regain their eternal sanätana positions in eternal association with the\nLord. The Lord comes Himself in different incarnations, or He sends His\nconfidential servants as sons or His associates or äcäryas to reclaim the\nconditioned souls.\nTherefore, sanätana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of\nreligion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship\nwith the eternal Supreme Lord. Sanätana-dharma refers, as stated previously,\nto the eternal occupation of the living entity. Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya has\nexplained the word sanätana as “that which has neither beginning nor end,” so\nwhen we speak of sanätana-dharma, we must take it for granted on the\nauthority of Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya that it has neither beginning nor end.\nThe English world religion is a little different from sanätana-dharma.\nReligion conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith\nin a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but\nsanätana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For\ninstance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from\nfire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be\ntaken from the living entity. Sanätana-dharma is eternally integral with the\nliving entity. When we speak of sanätana-dharma, therefore, we must take it\nfor granted on the authority of Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya that it has neither\nbeginning nor end. That which has neither end nor beginning must not be\nsectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some\nsectarian faith will wrongly consider that sanätana-dharma is also sectarian,\nbut if we go deeply into the matter and consider it in the light of modern\nscience, it is possible for us to see that sanätana-dharma is the business of all\nthe people of the world—nay, of all the living entities of the universe.\nNon-sanätana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of.\nhuman history, but there is no beginning to the history of sanätana-dharma,\nbecause it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living\nentities are concerned, the authoritative çästras state that the living entity has\nneither birth nor death. In the Gétä it is stated that the living entity is never\nborn and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to\nlive after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the\nconcept of sanätana-dharma, we must try to understand the concept of religion\nfrom the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma refers to that which is\nconstantly existing with a particular object. We conclude that there is heat\nand light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to\nthe word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being,\nthat part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his\neternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.\nWhen Sanätana Gosvämé asked Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu about the\nsvarüpa of every living being, the Lord replied that the svarüpa, or\nconstitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord\nCaitanya’s, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in\nrendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living\nbeings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The\nlower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B\nmaster, B serves C master, and C serves D master and so on. Under these\ncircumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother\nserves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so\non. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception\nin the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents\nhis manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The\nvoters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will\nrender valuable service to society. The shopkeeper serves the customer, and\nthe artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves the family, and the family\nserves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being.\nIn this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to\nother living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the.\nconstant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the\neternal religion of the living being.\nYet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to\nparticular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim,\nChristian, Buddhist or an adherent of any other sect. Such designations are\nnon—sanätana-dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or\na Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change\nhis faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does\nnot affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu,\nMuslim or Christian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to\nprofess a particular type of faith is not to profess one’s sanätana-dharma. The\nrendering of service is sanätana-dharma.\nFactually we are related to the Supreme Lord in service. The Supreme Lord\nis the supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created\nfor His enjoyment, and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment with the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy\notherwise. It is not possible to be happy independently, just as no one part of\nthe body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible\nfor the living entity to be happy without rendering transcendental loving\nservice unto the Supreme Lord.",
        "Introduction p5": "In the Bhagavad-gétä, worship of different demigods or rendering service to\nthem is not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth verse:\nkämais tais tair håta-jïänäù\nprapadyante ’nya-devatäù\ntaà taà niyamam ästhäya\nprakåtyä niyatäù svayä\n“Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender\nunto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship\naccording to their own natures.” Here it is plainly said that those who are\ndirected by lust worship the demigods and not the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. When\nwe mention the name Kåñëa, we do not refer to any sectarian name. Kåñëa\nmeans the highest pleasure, and it is confirmed that the Supreme Lord is the.\nreservoir or storehouse of all pleasure. We are all hankering after pleasure.\nÄnanda-mayo ’bhyäsät (Vedänta-sütra 1.1.12). The living entities, like the Lord,\nare full of consciousness, and they are after happiness. The Lord is perpetually\nhappy, and if the living entities associate with the Lord, cooperate with Him\nand take part in His association, then they also become happy.\nThe Lord descends to this mortal world to show His pastimes in Våndävana,\nwhich are full of happiness. When Lord Çré Kåñëa was in Våndävana, His\nactivities with His cowherd boyfriends, with His damsel friends, with the other\ninhabitants of Våndävana and with the cows were all full of happiness. The\ntotal population of Våndävana knew nothing but Kåñëa. But Lord Kåñëa even\ndiscouraged His father Nanda Mahäräja from worshiping the demigod Indra,\nbecause He wanted to establish the fact that people need not worship any\ndemigod. They need only worship the Supreme Lord, because their ultimate\ngoal is to return to His abode.\nThe abode of Lord Çré Kåñëa is described in the Bhagavad-gétä, Fifteenth\nChapter, sixth verse:\nna tad bhäsayate süryo\nna çaçäìko na pävakaù\nyad gatvä na nivartante\ntad dhäma paramaà mama\n“That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by\nfire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.”\nThis verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a\nmaterial conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun,\nmoon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky\nthere is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind\nbecause the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti, the rays\nemanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach\nother planets, but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the Supreme\nLord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-saàhitä (5.37) it is\nbeautifully described: goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù. The Lord resides\neternally in His abode Goloka, yet He can be approached from this world, and.\nto this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, sac-cid-änanda-vigraha\n[Bs. 5.1]. When He manifests this form, there is no need for our imagining what\nHe looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and\nexhibits Himself as He is, as Çyämasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent\nderide Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being.\nBut because of this we should not consider the Lord one of us. It is by His\nomnipotency that He presents Himself in His real form before us and displays\nHis pastimes, which are replicas of those pastimes found in His abode.\nIn the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets\nfloating. The brahmajyoti emanates from the supreme abode, Kåñëaloka, and\nthe änanda-maya, cin-maya planets, which are not material, float in those rays.\nThe Lord says, na tad bhäsayate süryo na çaçäìko na pävakaù/ yad gatvä na\nnivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama [Bg. 15.6]. One who can approach that\nspiritual sky is not required to descend again to the material sky. In the\nmaterial sky, even if we approach the highest planet (Brahmaloka), what to\nspeak of the moon, we will find the same conditions of life, namely birth,\ndeath, disease and old age. No planet in the material universe is free from\nthese four principles of material existence.\nThe living entities are traveling from one planet to another, but it is not\nthat we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement. If\nwe desire to go to other planets, there is a process for going there. This is also\nmentioned: yänti deva-vratä devän pitèn yänti pitå-vratäù [Bg. 9.25]. No\nmechanical arrangement is necessary if we want interplanetary travel. The\nGétä instructs: yänti deva-vratä devän. The moon, the sun and higher planets\nare called Svargaloka. There are three different statuses of planets: higher,\nmiddle and lower planetary systems. The earth belongs to the middle planetary\nsystem. Bhagavad-gétä informs us how to travel to the higher planetary systems\n(Devaloka) with a very simple formula: yänti deva-vratä devän. One need only\nworship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to\nthe moon, the sun or any of the higher planetary systems.\nYet Bhagavad-gétä does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this\nmaterial world, because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet,\nthrough some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty.\nthousand years (and who would live that long?), we will still find the material\ninconveniences of birth, death, disease and old age. But one who wants to\napproach the supreme planet, Kåñëaloka, or any of the other planets within\nthe spiritual sky, will not meet with these material inconveniences. Amongst\nall of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka\nVåndävana, which is the original planet in the abode of the original\nPersonality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. All of this information is given in\nBhagavad-gétä, and we are given through its instruction information how to\nleave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky.\nIn the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, the real picture of the\nmaterial world is given. It is said there:\nürdhva-mülam adhaù-çäkham\naçvatthaà prähur avyayam\nchandäàsi yasya parëäni\nyas taà veda sa veda-vit\nHere the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and\nbranches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if\none stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the\ntrees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward and\nthe roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual\nworld. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the shadow there is no\nreality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there are\nsubstance and reality. In the desert there is no water, but the mirage suggests\nthat there is such a thing as water. In the material world there is no water,\nthere is no happiness, but the real water of actual happiness is there in the\nspiritual world.\nThe Lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following\nmanner (Bg. 15.5):\nnirmäna-mohä jita-saìga-doñä\nadhyätma-nityä vinivåtta-kämäù\ndvandvair vimuktäù sukha-duùkha-saàjïair\ngacchanty amüòhäù padam avyayaà tat.\nThat padam avyayam, or eternal kingdom, can be reached by one who is\nnirmäna-moha. What does this mean? We are after designations. Someone\nwants to become “sir,” someone wants to become “lord,” someone wants to\nbecome the president or a rich man or a king or something else. As long as we\nare attached to these designations, we are attached to the body, because\ndesignations belong to the body. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this\nis the first stage in spiritual realization. We are associated with the three modes\nof material nature, but we must become detached through devotional service\nto the Lord. If we are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we\ncannot become detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and\nattachments are due to our lust and desire, our wanting to lord it over the\nmaterial nature. As long as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over\nmaterial nature, there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the\nSupreme, the sanätana-dhäma. That eternal kingdom, which is never\ndestroyed, can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions\nof false material enjoyments, who is situated in the service of the Supreme\nLord. One so situated can easily approach that supreme abode.\nElsewhere in the Gétä (8.21) it is stated:\navyakto ’kñara ity uktas\ntam ähuù paramäà gatim\nyaà präpya na nivartante\ntad dhäma paramaà mama\nAvyakta means unmanifested. Not even all of the material world is\nmanifested before us. Our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see all\nof the stars within this material universe. In Vedic literature we can receive\nmuch information about all the planets, and we can believe it or not believe it.\nAll of the important planets are described in Vedic literatures, especially\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam, and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material sky,\nis described as avyakta, unmanifested. One should desire and hanker after that\nsupreme kingdom, for when one attains that kingdom, he does not have to\nreturn to this material world.\nNext, one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching that.\nabode of the Supreme Lord. Information of this is given in the Eighth\nChapter. It is said there:\nanta-käle ca mäm eva\nsmaran muktvä kalevaram\nyaù prayäti sa mad-bhävaà\nyäti nästy atra saàçayaù\n“Anyone who quits his body, at the end of life, remembering Me, attains\nimmediately to My nature; and there is no doubt of this.” [Bg. 8.5] One who\nthinks of Kåñëa at the time of his death goes to Kåñëa. One must remember the\nform of Kåñëa; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he surely approaches\nthe spiritual kingdom. Mad-bhävam refers to the supreme nature of the\nSupreme Being. The Supreme Being is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]—that\nis, His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. Our present body is not\nsac-cid-änanda. It is asat, not sat. It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not cit,\nfull of knowledge, but it is full of ignorance. We have no knowledge of the\nspiritual kingdom, nor do we even have perfect knowledge of this material\nworld, where there are so many things unknown to us. The body is also\nniränanda; instead of being full of bliss it is full of misery. All of the miseries\nwe experience in the material world arise from the body, but one who leaves\nthis body thinking of Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at\nonce attains a sac-cid-änanda body.\nThe process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material\nworld is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body\nhe will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself,\nmake this decision. According to our activities in this life, we either rise or\nsink. This life is a preparation for the next life. If we can prepare, therefore, in\nthis life to get promotion to the kingdom of God, then surely, after quitting\nthis material body, we will attain a spiritual body just like the Lord’s.\nAs explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists—the\nbrahma-vädé, paramätma-vädé and the devotee—and, as mentioned, in the\nbrahmajyoti (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The\nnumber of these planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this.\nmaterial world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter\nof the creation (ekäàçena sthito jagat). In this material segment there are\nmillions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns, stars and\nmoons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total\ncreation. Most of the creation is in the spiritual sky. One who desires to merge\ninto the existence of the Supreme Brahman is at once transferred to the\nbrahmajyoti of the Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The\ndevotee, who wants to enjoy the association of the Lord, enters into the\nVaikuëöha planets, which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His\nplenary expansions as Näräyaëa with four hands and with different names like\nPradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at\nthe end of life the transcendentalists think either of the brahmajyoti, the\nParamätmä or Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. In all cases they\nenter into the spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is in personal\ntouch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaikuëöha planets or the\nGoloka Våndävana planet. The Lord further adds that of this “there is no\ndoubt.” This must be believed firmly. We should not reject that which does not\ntally with our imagination; our attitude should be that of Arjuna: “I believe\neverything that You have said.” Therefore when the Lord says that at the time\nof death whoever thinks of Him as Brahman or Paramätmä or as the\nPersonality of Godhead certainly enters into the spiritual sky, there is no\ndoubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it.",
        "Introduction p6": "The Bhagavad-gétä (8.6) also explains the general principle that makes it\npossible to enter the spiritual kingdom simply by thinking of the Supreme at\nthe time of death:\nyaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà\ntyajaty ante kalevaram\ntaà tam evaiti kaunteya\nsadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù\n“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body, in\nhis next life he will attain to that state without fail.” Now, first we must\nunderstand that material nature is a display of one of the energies of the.\nSupreme Lord. In the Viñëu Puräëa (6.7.61) the total energies of the Supreme\nLord are delineated:\nviñëu-çaktiù parä proktä\nkñetra-jïäkhyä tathä parä\navidyä-karma-saàjïänyä\ntåtéyä çaktir iñyate\n[Cc. Madhya 6.154]\nThe Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are beyond\nour conception; however, great learned sages or liberated souls have studied\nthese energies and have analyzed them into three parts. All of the energies are\nof viñëu-çakti, that is to say they are different potencies of Lord Viñëu. The\nfirst energy is parä, transcendental. Living entities also belong to the superior\nenergy, as has already been explained. The other energies, or material energies,\nare in the mode of ignorance. At the time of death either we can remain in the\ninferior energy of this material world, or we can transfer to the energy of the\nspiritual world. So the Bhagavad-gétä (8.6) says:\nyaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà\ntyajaty ante kalevaram\ntaà tam evaiti kaunteya\nsadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù\n“Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his present body, in\nhis next life he will attain to that state without fail.”\nIn life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or of the\nspiritual energy. Now, how can we transfer our thoughts from the material\nenergy to the spiritual energy? There are so many literatures which fill our\nthoughts with the material energy—newspapers, magazines, novels, etc. Our\nthinking, which is now absorbed in these literatures, must be transferred to the\nVedic literatures. The great sages, therefore, have written so many Vedic\nliteratures, such as the Puräëas. The Puräëas are not imaginative; they are\nhistorical records. In the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 20.122) there is the\nfollowing verse:.\nmäyä-mugdha jévera nähi svataù kåñëa-jïäna\njévere kåpäya kailä kåñëa veda-puräëa\nThe forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their\nrelationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking of\nmaterial activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky,\nKåñëa-dvaipäyana Vyäsa has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First he\ndivided the Vedas into four, then he explained them in the Puräëas, and for\nless capable people he wrote the Mahäbhärata. In the Mahäbhärata there is\ngiven the Bhagavad-gétä. Then all Vedic literature is summarized in the\nVedänta-sütra, and for future guidance he gave a natural commentation on the\nVedänta-sütra, called Çrémad-Bhägavatam. We must always engage our minds\nin reading these Vedic literatures. Just as materialists engage their minds in\nreading newspapers, magazines and so many materialistic literatures, we must\ntransfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by Vyäsadeva; in\nthat way it will be possible for us to remember the Supreme Lord at the time of\ndeath. That is the only way suggested by the Lord, and He guarantees the\nresult: “There is no doubt.”\ntasmät sarveñu käleñu\nmäm anusmara yudhya ca\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhir\nmäm evaiñyasy asaàçayaù\n“Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Kåñëa\nand at the same time continue your prescribed duty of fighting. With your\nactivities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you\nwill attain Me without doubt.” (Bg. 8.7)\nHe does not advise Arjuna simply to remember Him and give up his\noccupation. No, the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material\nworld, in order to maintain the body one has to work. Human society is\ndivided, according to work, into four divisions of social order—brähmaëa,\nkñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra. The brähmaëa class or intelligent class is working in\none way, the kñatriya or administrative class is working in another way, and.\nthe mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties. In\nthe human society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, administrator or\nfarmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a\nscientist or a theologian, he has to work in order to maintain his existence.\nThe Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but\nwhile he is engaged in his occupation he should remember Kåñëa (mäm\nanusmara [Bg. 8.7]). If he doesn’t practice remembering Kåñëa while he is\nstruggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to remember Kåñëa\nat the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says, kértanéyaù sadä\nhariù: [Cc. adi 17.31] one should practice chanting the names of the Lord\nalways. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord Kåñëa’s\ninstructions to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to\n“always chant the names of Lord Kåñëa” are the same instruction. There is no\ndifference, because Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute\nstatus there is no difference between reference and referrent. Therefore we\nhave to practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by\nchanting His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can\nremember Him always.",
        "Introduction p7": "How is this possible? The äcäryas give the following example. If a married\nwoman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman\nother than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One\nwith such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is\nthinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is\ncarrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work\neven more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly,\nwe should always remember the supreme lover, Çré Kåñëa, and at the same time\nperform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here.\nIf we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge\nour duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that\nsense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kåñëa; he was the\nconstant companion of Kåñëa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kåñëa\ndid not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When\nLord Kåñëa delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice.\nof this system is not possible for him.\narjuna uväca\nyo ’yaà yogas tvayä proktaù\nsämyena madhusüdana\netasyähaà na paçyämi\ncaïcalatvät sthitià sthiräm\n“Arjuna said: O Madhusüdana, the system of yoga which You have\nsummarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is\nrestless and unsteady.” (Bg. 6.33)\nBut the Lord says:\nyoginäm api sarveñäà\nmad-gatenäntarätmanä\nçraddhävän bhajate yo mäà\nsa me yuktatamo mataù\n“Of all yogés, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me\nwithin himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me is the most\nintimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My\nopinion.” (Bg. 6.47) So one who thinks of the Supreme Lord always is the\ngreatest yogé, the supermost jïäné, and the greatest devotee at the same time.\nThe Lord further tells Arjuna that as a kñatriya he cannot give up his fighting,\nbut if Arjuna fights remembering Kåñëa, then he will be able to remember\nKåñëa at the time of death. But one must be completely surrendered in the\ntranscendental loving service of the Lord.\nWe work not with our body, actually, but with our mind and intelligence.\nSo if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the\nSupreme Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service.\nSuperficially, at least, the activities of the senses remain the same, but the\nconsciousness is changed. The Bhagavad-gétä teaches one how to absorb the\nmind and intelligence in the thought of the Lord. Such absorption will enable\none to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord. If the mind is engaged in\nKåñëa’s service, then the senses are automatically engaged in His service. This.\nis the art, and this is also the secret of Bhagavad-gétä: total absorption in the\nthought of Çré Kåñëa.\nModern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon, but he has not\ntried very hard to elevate himself spiritually. If one has fifty years of life ahead\nof him, he should engage that brief time in cultivating this practice of\nremembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This practice is the\ndevotional process:\nçravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù\nsmaraëaà päda-sevanam\narcanaà vandanaà däsyaà\nsakhyam ätma-nivedanam\n(Çrémad-Bhägavatam 7.5.23)\nThese nine processes, of which the easiest is çravaëam, hearing the\nBhagavad-gétä from the realized person, will turn one to the thought of the\nSupreme Being. This will lead to remembering the Supreme Lord and will\nenable one, upon leaving the body, to attain a spiritual body which is just fit\nfor association with the Supreme Lord.\nThe Lord further says:\nabhyäsa-yoga-yuktena\ncetasä nänya-gäminä\nparamaà puruñaà divyaà\nyäti pärthänucintayan\n“He who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind\nconstantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O\nArjuna, is sure to reach Me.” (Bg. 8.8)\nThis is not a very difficult process. However, one must learn it from an\nexperienced person. Tad vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigacchet: [MU 1.2.12(3)]\none must approach a person who is already in the practice. The mind is always\nflying to this and that, but one must practice concentrating the mind always\non the form of the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, or on the sound of His name. The\nmind is naturally restless, going hither and thither, but it can rest in the sound.\nvibration of Kåñëa. One must thus meditate on paramaà puruñam, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual kingdom, the spiritual sky,\nand thus attain Him. The ways and the means for ultimate realization,\nultimate attainment, are stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, and the doors of this\nknowledge are open for everyone. No one is barred out. All classes of men can\napproach Lord Kåñëa by thinking of Him, for hearing and thinking of Him is\npossible for everyone.\nThe Lord further says (Bg. 9.32–33):\nmäà hi pärtha vyapäçritya\nye ’pi syuù päpa-yonayaù\nstriyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräs\nte ’pi yänti paräà gatim\nkià punar brähmaëäù puëyä\nbhaktä räjarñayas tathä\nanityam asukhaà lokam\nimaà präpya bhajasva mäm\nThus the Lord says that even a merchant, a fallen woman or a laborer or\neven human beings in the lowest status of life can attain the Supreme. One\ndoes not need highly developed intelligence. The point is that anyone who\naccepts the principle of bhakti-yoga and accepts the Supreme Lord as the\nsummum bonum of life, as the highest target, the ultimate goal, can approach\nthe Lord in the spiritual sky. If one adopts the principles enunciated in\nBhagavad-gétä, he can make his life perfect and make a permanent solution to\nall the problems of life. This is the sum and substance of the entire\nBhagavad-gétä.\nIn conclusion, Bhagavad-gétä is a transcendental literature which one\nshould read very carefully. Gétä-çästram idaà puëyaà yaù paöhet prayataù\npumän: if one properly follows the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä, one can be\nfreed from all the miseries and anxieties of life. Bhaya-çokädi-varjitaù. One will\nbe freed from all fears in this life, and one’s next life will be spiritual.\n(Gétä-mähätmya 1)\nThere is also a further advantage:.\ngétädhyäyana-çélasya\npräëäyama-parasya ca\nnaiva santi hi päpäni\npürva-janma-kåtäni ca\n“If one reads Bhagavad-gétä very sincerely and with all seriousness, then by\nthe grace of the Lord the reactions of his past misdeeds will not act upon him.”\n(Gétä-mähätmya 2) The Lord says very loudly in the last portion of\nBhagavad-gétä (18.66):\nsarva-dharmän parityajya\nmäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja\nahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo\nmokñayiñyämi mä çucaù\n“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall\ndeliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” Thus the Lord takes all\nresponsibility for one who surrenders unto Him, and He indemnifies such a\nperson against all reactions of sins.\nmaline mocanaà puàsäà\njala-snänaà dine dine\nsakåd gétämåta-snänaà\nsaàsära-mala-näçanam\n“One may cleanse himself daily by taking a bath in water, but if one takes a\nbath even once in the sacred Ganges water of Bhagavad-gétä, for him the dirt\nof material life is altogether vanquished.” (Gétä-mähätmya 3)\ngétä su-gétä kartavyä\nkim anyaiù çästra-vistaraiù\nyä svayaà padmanäbhasya\nmukha-padmäd viniùsåtä\nBecause Bhagavad-gétä is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\none need not read any other Vedic literature. One need only attentively and\nregularly hear and read Bhagavad-gétä. In the present age, people are so.\nabsorbed in mundane activities that it is not possible for them to read all the\nVedic literatures. But this is not necessary. This one book, Bhagavad-gétä, will\nsuffice, because it is the essence of all Vedic literatures and especially because\nit is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (Gétä-mähätmya 4)\nAs it is said:\nbhäratämåta-sarvasvaà\nviñëu-vakträd viniùsåtam\ngétä-gaìgodakaà pétvä\npunar janma na vidyate\n“One who drinks the water of the Ganges attains salvation, so what to\nspeak of one who drinks the nectar of Bhagavad-gétä? Bhagavad-gétä is the\nessential nectar of the Mahäbhärata, and it is spoken by Lord Kåñëa Himself,\nthe original Viñëu.” (Gétä-mähätmya 5) Bhagavad-gétä comes from the mouth\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Ganges is said to emanate\nfrom the lotus feet of the Lord. Of course, there is no difference between the\nmouth and the feet of the Supreme Lord, but from an impartial study we can\nappreciate that Bhagavad-gétä is even more important than the water of the\nGanges.\nsarvopaniñado gävo\ndogdhä gopäla-nandanaù\npärtho vatsaù su-dhér bhoktä\ndugdhaà gétämåtaà mahat\n“This Gétopaniñad, Bhagavad-gétä, the essence of all the Upaniñads, is just\nlike a cow, and Lord Kåñëa, who is famous as a cowherd boy, is milking this\ncow. Arjuna is just like a calf, and learned scholars and pure devotees are to\ndrink the nectarean milk of Bhagavad-gétä.” (Gétä-mähätmya 6)\nekaà çästraà devaké-putra-gétam\neko devo devaké-putra eva\neko mantras tasya nämäni yäni\nkarmäpy ekaà tasya devasya sevä\n(Gétä-mähätmya 7).\nIn this present day, people are very much eager to have one scripture, one\nGod, one religion, and one occupation. Therefore, ekaà çästraà\ndevaké-putra-gétam: let there be one scripture only, one common scripture for\nthe whole world—Bhagavad-gétä. Eko devo devaké-putra eva: let there be one\nGod for the whole world—Çré Kåñëa. Eko mantras tasya nämäni: and one\nhymn, one mantra, one prayer—the chanting of His name: Hare Kåñëa, Hare\nKåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare\nHare. Karmäpy ekaà tasya devasya sevä: and let there be one work only—the\nservice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

        "PurPort": " Bhagavad-gétä is the widely read theistic science summarized in the\nGétä-mähätmya (Glorification of the Gétä). There it says that one should read\nBhagavad-gétä very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of\nÇré Krsna and try to understand it without personally motivated\ninterpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the\nBhagavad-gétä itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who\nheard the Gétä directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to\nunderstand Bhagavad-gétä in that line of disciplic succession, without\nmotivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all\nscriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gétä all that is contained\nin other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be\nfound elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the Gétä. It is the perfect\ntheistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Lord Çré Krsna.\nThe topics discussed by Dhåtaräñöra and Saïjaya, as described in the\nMahäbhärata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is\nunderstood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra,\nwhich is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic\nage. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet\nfor the guidance of mankind.\nThe word dharma-kñetra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is\nsignificant because, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhåtaräñöra, the father of the\nKurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. In\nhis doubt, he inquired from his secretary Saïjaya, “What did they do?” He was\nconfident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Päëòu were\nassembled in that Field of Kurukñetra for a determined engagement of the war.\nStill, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the\ncousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the\nbattlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kurukñetra, which\nis mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship—even for the\ndenizens of heaven—Dhåtaräñöra became very fearful about the influence of\nthe holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Päëòu favorably, because by nature they\nwere all virtuous. Saïjaya was a student of Vyäsa, and therefore, by the mercy\nof Vyäsa, Saïjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kurukñetra even while\nhe was in the room of Dhåtaräñöra. And so, Dhåtaräñöra asked him about the\nsituation on the battlefield.\nBoth the Päëòavas and the sons of Dhåtaräñöra belong to the same family,\nbut Dhåtaräñöra’s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his\nsons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Päëòu from the family heritage.\nOne can thus understand the specific position of Dhåtaräñöra in his\nrelationship with his nephews, the sons of Päëòu. As in the paddy field the\nunnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of\nthese topics that in the religious field of Kurukñetra, where the father of\nreligion, Çré Krsna, was present, the unwanted plants like Dhåtaräñöra’s son\nDuryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious\npersons, headed by Yudhiñöhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the\nsignificance of the words dharma-kñetre and kuru-kñetre, apart from their\nhistorical and Vedic importance"

Still he was\ndoubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Saïjaya could\nunderstand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. Saïjaya\nwanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent king and thus assured him\nthat his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the\ninfluence of the holy place. Saïjaya therefore informed the king that his son,\nDuryodhana, after seeing the military force of the Päëòavas, at once went to\nthe commander in chief, Droëäcärya, to inform him of the real position.\nAlthough Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the\ncommander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He was therefore\nquite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana’s diplomatic veneer could not\ndisguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the\nPäëòavas."

For example, His name is Madhusüdana\nbecause He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda\nbecause He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Väsudeva\nbecause He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaké-nandana\nbecause He accepted Devaké as His mother; His name is Yaçodä-nandana\nbecause He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yaçodä at Våndävana; His\nname is Pärtha-särathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna.\nSimilarly, His name is Håñékeça because He gave direction to Arjuna on the\nBattlefield of Kurukñetra.\nArjuna is referred to as Dhanaïjaya in this verse because he helped his\nelder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make\nexpenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhéma is known as Våkodara\nbecause he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such\nas killing the demon Hiòimba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by\nthe different personalities on the side of the Päëòavas, beginning with the\nLord’s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side\nthere were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord Krsna, the supreme\ndirector, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So they were predestined to lose\nthe battle—and that was the message announced by the sounds of the\nconchshells."

        "PurPort": "Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities\nwhich are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee,\nhowever advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and\nculture, lacks in godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen,\nfriends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by\ncompassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as\nhis soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he\nfelt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their\nimminent death. And while he was so thinking, the limbs of his body began to\nquiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their\nfighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna,\nhad come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna.\nAlthough it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only\nwere Arjuna’s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but he was also\ncrying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness\nbut to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is\nsaid therefore:\nyasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä\nsarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù\nharäv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guëä\nmano-rathenäsati dhävato bahiù\n“One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all\nthe good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is\nhovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring\nmaterial energy.” (Bhäg. 5.18.12)"

Arjuna’s symptoms in this situation are out of material\nfear—namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became\nso impatient that his famous bow Gäëòéva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation\nof the skin.

Bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät (Bhäg. 11.2.37): such fearfulness and\nloss of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by\nmaterial conditions. Arjuna envisioned only painful reverses in the battlefield—he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The\nwords nimittäni viparétäni are significant. When a man sees only frustration in\nhis expectations, he thinks, “Why am I here?” Everyone is interested in himself\nand his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is\nshowing ignorance of his real self-interest by Kåñëa’s will. One’s real\nself-interest lies in Viñëu, or Krsna. The conditioned soul forgets this, and\ntherefore suffers material pains.

In such a blind conception of life, they forget even the causes\nof material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes\nfor a kñatriya. It is said that two kinds of men, namely the kñatriya who dies\ndirectly in front of the battlefield under Kåñëa’s personal orders and the\nperson in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual\nculture, are eligible to enter into the sun globe, which is so powerful and\ndazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He\nthinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and\ntherefore he is not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is\nnot inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a\nsecluded life in frustration. But as a kñatriya, he requires a kingdom for his\nsubsistence, because the kñatriyas cannot engage themselves in any other\noccupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom. Arjuna’s sole opportunity for gaining\na kingdom lies in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the\nkingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he\nconsiders himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration."

Such aggressors are at once to be killed,\nand no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is\nquite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He\nwas saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in\nsaintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kñatriya. Although a\nresponsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he\nshould not be cowardly. For example, Lord Räma was so saintly that people\neven now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord Räma (räma-räjya), but\nLord Räma never showed any cowardice. Rävaëa was an aggressor against\nRäma because Rävaëa kidnapped Räma’s wife, Sétä, but Lord Räma gave him\nsufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna’s case,\nhowever, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own\ngrandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them,\nArjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against\nordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such\ninjunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for\npolitical reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and\nsaintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply\nfor the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and\npleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life\nand eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna’s addressing of Krsna\nas “Mädhava,” or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in\nthis connection. He wanted to point out to Krsna that, as husband of the\ngoddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which\nwould ultimately bring about misfortune. Krsna, however, never brings\nmisfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees."

        "PurPort": "Material compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the\nreal self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word\n“Madhusüdana” is significant in this verse. Lord Krsna killed the demon\nMadhu, and now Arjuna wanted Krsna to kill the demon of misunderstanding\nthat had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where\ncompassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is\nsenseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by\nrescuing his outward dress—the gross material body. One who does not know\nthis and laments for the outward dress is called a çüdra, or one who laments\nunnecessarily. Arjuna was a kñatriya, and this conduct was not expected from\nhim. Lord Krsna, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man,\nand for this purpose the Bhagavad-gétä was sung by Him. This chapter instructs\nus in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit\nsoul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord Çré Krsna. This realization is\npossible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated\nin the fixed conception of the real self."

        "PurPort": "Krsna and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore\nLord Krsna is referred to as Bhagavän throughout the Gétä. Bhagavän is the\nultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of\nunderstanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramätmä, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all\nliving entities; and Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord\nKrsna. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11) this conception of the Absolute\nTruth is explained thus:\nvadanti tat tattva-vidas\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam\nbrahmeti paramätmeti\nbhagavän iti çabdyate\n“The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the\nknower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of\nthe Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramätmä, and Bhagavän.”\nThese three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun,\nwhich also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface\nand the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary\nstudent. One who understands the sun’s surface is further advanced. And one\nwho can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are\nsatisfied by simply understanding the sunshine—its universal pervasiveness\nand the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature—may be compared to those\nwho can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student\nwho has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to\nknowledge of the Paramätmä feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student\nwho can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who\nrealize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the\nbhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavän feature of\nthe Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students\nwho are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same\nsubject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun\nplanet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three\ndifferent phases are not in the same category.\nThe Sanskrit word bhagavän is explained by the great authority Paräçara\nMuni, the father of Vyäsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all\nriches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavän. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful,\nvery beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one\ncan claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Krsna\ncan claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living\nentity, including Brahmä, Lord Çiva, or Näräyaëa, can possess opulences as\nfully as Krsna. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-saàhitä by Lord\nBrahmä himself that Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No\none is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavän, known as\nGovinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes:\néçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù\nsac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù\nanädir ädir govindaù\nsarva-käraëa-käraëam\n“There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavän, but\nKrsna is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person,\nand His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord\nGovinda and the cause of all causes.” (Brahma-saàhitä 5.1)\nIn the Bhägavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, but Krsna is described as the original Personality of\nGodhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead\nexpand:\nete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù\nkåñëas tu bhagavän svayam\nindräri-vyäkulaà lokaà\nmåòayanti yuge yuge\n“All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either\nplenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme\nGodhead, but Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.” (Bhäg.\n1.3.28)\nTherefore, Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the\nAbsolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.\nIn the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s\nlamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore. Krsna\nexpressed His surprise with the word kutaù, “wherefrom.” Such impurities were\nnever expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as\nÄryans. The word Äryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life\nand have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by\nthe material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of\nthe Absolute Truth, Viñëu, or Bhagavän, and they are captivated by the\nexternal features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what\nliberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material\nbondage are called non-Äryans. Although Arjuna was a kñatriya, he was\ndeviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of\ncowardice is described as befitting the non-Äryans. Such deviation from duty\ndoes not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the\nopportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Krsna did not approve of the\nso-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen."

If the son of a kñatriya declines to fight, he is a kñatriya in name only,\nand if the son of a brähmaëa acts impiously, he is a brähmaëa in name only.\nSuch kñatriyas and brähmaëas are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore,\nKrsna did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a kñatriya. Arjuna\nwas the most intimate friend of Krsna, and Krsna was directly guiding him on\nthe chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle he\nwould be committing an infamous act. Therefore Krsna said that such an\nattitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he\nwould give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the\nmost respectable Bhéñma and his relatives, but Krsna considered that sort of\nmagnanimity mere weakness of heart. Such false magnanimity was not\napproved by any authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called\nnonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct\nguidance of Krsna."

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it\nbehooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper\nguidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to\napproach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life,\nwhich happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow\nblazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such’ that\nperplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion.\nNo one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic\nwisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to\nunderstand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master\nwho is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is\nsupposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material\nperplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this\nverse.\nWho is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand\nthe problems of life. In the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (3.8.10) the perplexed\nman is described as follows: yo vä etad akñaraà gärgy aviditväsmäû lokät praiti sa\nkåpaëaù. “He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a\nhuman and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without\nunderstanding the science of self-realization.” This human form of life is a\nmost valuable asset for the living entity who can utilize it for solving the\nproblems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the brähmaëa, or he who is intelligent\nenough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad akñaraà\ngärgi viditväsmäû lokät praiti sa brähmaëaù.\nThe kåpaëas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly\naffectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life.\nOne is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other\nmembers, on the basis of “skin disease.” The kåpaëa thinks that he is able to\nprotect his family members from death; or the kåpaëa thinks that his family or\nsociety can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be\nfound even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. Being\nintelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and\nhis wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities.\nAlthough he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on\naccount of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore\nasking Lord Krsna, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution.\nHe offers himself to Krsna as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks\nbetween the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk\nvery seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Krsna is therefore the\noriginal spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gétä, and Arjuna is the first\ndisciple for understanding the Gétä. How Arjuna understands the\nBhagavad-gétä is stated in the Gétä itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars\nexplain that one need not submit to Krsna as a person, but to “the unborn\nwithin Krsna.” There is no difference between Kåñëa’s within and without.\nAnd one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying\nto understand Bhagavad-gétä"

        "PurPort": "Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on\nknowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was\nunable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord\nÇré Krsna. He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in\ndriving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it\nwas impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual\nmaster like Lord Krsna. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc.,\nare all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a\nspiritual master like Krsna. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master\nwho is one hundred percent Krsna conscious is the bona fide spiritual master,\nfor he can solve the problems of life.

It is also\nsaid in Vedic literature:\nñaö-karma-nipuëo vipro\nmantra-tantra-viçäradaù\navaiñëavo gurur na syäd\nvaiñëavaù çva-paco guruù\n“A scholarly brähmaëa, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to\nbecome a spiritual master without being a Vaiñëava, or expert in the science of\nKrsna consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become\na spiritual master if he is a Vaiñëava, or Krsna conscious.” (Padma Puräëa)\nThe problems of material existence—birth, old age, disease and\ndeath—cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic\ndevelopment. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete\nwith all facilities of life, which are full of wealth and economically developed,\nyet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace\nin different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult\nKrsna, or the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam—which constitute the\nscience of Kåñëa—through the bona fide representative of Krsna, the man in\nKrsna consciousness.\nIf economic development and material comforts could drive away one’s\nlamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then\nArjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or\nsupremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Krsna\nconsciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic\ndevelopment or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by\nthe cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary\nsituation, as men are now seeking on the moon planet, can also be finished at\none stroke. The Bhagavad-gétä confirms this: kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti.\n“When the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from\nthe peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.” Many politicians of the\nworld have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more\ncauses for lamentation.\nTherefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take\nshelter of Krsna, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Krsna to solve his\nproblem definitely, and that is the way of Krsna consciousness"

They will not grieve for the living or for the dead because they know well that the Self is immortal and that It is unborn. They also know that there is no such a thing as death? that it is a separation of the astral body from the physical? that death is nothing more than a disintegration of matter and that the five elements of which the body is composed return to their source. Arjuna had forgotten the eternal nature of the Soul and the changing nature of the body.

He forgot that his relations with this world in his present life were the results of past actions.

Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given\nmore importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that\nknowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than\nreligious formularies. And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should\nnot have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a\nvery learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was\nunworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished\ntoday or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul.

That Supreme Personality of Godhead is\nalso, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only\nsaintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord can\nactually attain to perfect and eternal peace.\nnityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm\neko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän\ntam ätma-sthaà ye ’nupaçyanti dhéräs\nteñäà çäntiù çäçvaté netareñäm\nThe same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world\nwho pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of\nknowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings\nwho are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that\nthe Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in\ntheir conditioned and in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of\nGodhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord’s eternal\nassociate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is\nnot that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will\nnot remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their\nindividuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore,\nthere is no cause for lamentation for anyone.\nThe Mäyävädé theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by\nthe covering of mäyä, or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and\nlose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Kåñëa, the\nsupreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the\nconditioned state supported herein. Kåñëa clearly says herein that in the\nfuture also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the\nUpaniñads, will continue eternally. This statement of Kåñëa’s is authoritative\nbecause Kåñëa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact,\nthen Kåñëa would not have stressed it so much—even for the future. The\nMäyävädé may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kåñëa is not spiritual,\nbut material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material,\nthen how can one distinguish Kåñëa’s individuality? Kåñëa affirms His\nindividuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He\nhas confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has\nbeen declared to be subordinate to Him. Kåñëa has maintained spiritual\nindividuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in\nindividual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gétä has no value as authoritative\nscripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable\nto teach that which is worth hearing. The Gétä is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-gétä. When one accepts Kåñëa as\nan ordinary man, the Gétä loses all importance. The Mäyävädé argues that the\nplurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body.\nBut previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned.\nAfter condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it\npossible for Kåñëa to place a conventional proposition on the body again?\nTherefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus\nconfirmed by great äcäryas like Çré Rämänuja and others. It is clearly\nmentioned in many places in the Gétä that this spiritual individuality is\nunderstood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of\nKåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the\ngreat literature. The nondevotee’s approach to the teachings of the Gétä is\nsomething like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a\ntaste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the\nBhagavad-gétä can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it,\nas it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the Gétä be touched\nby persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the Mäyävädé\nexplanation of the Gétä is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth.\nLord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the Mäyävädés\nand warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the Mäyävädé\nphilosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the Gétä. If\nindividuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching\nby the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal\nfact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned."

Just as the Self passes unchanged from childhood to youth and from yourth to old age? so also the Self passes unchanged from one body into,another. Therefore? the wise man is not at all distressed about it.",
        "PurPort": "Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body\nevery moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and\nsometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not\nundergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death\nand transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in\nthe next birth—either material or spiritual—there was no cause for\nlamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhéñma nor for Droëa,\nfor whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their\nchanging bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such\nchanges of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to\none’s work in life. So Bhéñma and Droëa, being noble souls, were surely going\nto have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for\nsuperior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause\nof lamentation.\nAny man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual\nsoul, the Supersoul, and nature—both material and spiritual—is called a dhéra,\nor a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The Mäyävädé theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on\nthe ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental\nportion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme\ncleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul’s being\nunchangeable. As confirmed in the Gétä, the fragmental portions of the\nSupreme exist eternally (sanätana) and are called kñara; that is, they have a\ntendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are\neternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the\nsame—fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and\nknowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be\napplied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and\nis known as the Paramätmä. He is different from the individual living entity.\nWhen the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and\nthe moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities\nand the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental\nspirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of\nGodhead Çré Kåñëa. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in\nthe beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with\nKåñëa, and Kåñëa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of\ninstructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by\nthe illusory energy (mäyä), then there is no need of one being the instructor\nand the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the\nclutches of mäyä, no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the\ncircumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord, superior in\nposition to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by mäyä. "

        "PurPort": "Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of\nspiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and\nhappiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation.

Similarly, in\nArjuna’s discharge of duties as a kñatriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it\nis difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord\nCaitanya took sannyäsa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young\nwife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them.

        "PurPort": "There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing\nevery moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by\nmodern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the\nbody. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all\nchanges of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and\nspirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This\nconclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist\nand personalist. In the Viñëu Puräëa (2.12.38) it is stated that Viñëu and His\nabodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence (jyotéàñi viñëur bhuvanäni\nviñëuù). The words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter.\nThat is the version of all seers of truth.\nThis is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities\nwho are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance\ninvolves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper\nand the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference\nbetween the part-and-parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study\nof oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood\nas the relationship between the part and the whole. In the Vedänta-sütras, as\nwell as in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the\norigin of all emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and\ninferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as\nit will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference\nbetween the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the\nSupreme, and energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living\nentities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case\nof the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear\nknowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-gétä for the\nenlightenment of all living entities for all time"

        "PurPort": "This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread\nall over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is\nconsciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in\npart or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one’s own\nbody. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore,\neach and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom\nof the soul’s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in\nsize. The Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (5.9) confirms this:\nbälägra-çata-bhägasya\nçatadhä kalpitasya ca\nbhägo jévaù vijïeyaù\nsa cänantyäya kalpate\n“When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and\nagain each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such\npart is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.” Similarly the same\nversion is stated:\nkeçägra-çata-bhägasya\nçatäàçaù sädåçätmakaù\njévaù sükñma-svarüpo ’yaà\nsaìkhyätéto hi cit-kaëaù\n [Cc. Madya 19.140]\n“There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as\none ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.”\nTherefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller\nthan the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small\nspiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of\nsuch a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active\nprinciple of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the\nspirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the\npresence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus\nconsciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the\nbody by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not\ndue to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the\nMuëòaka Upaniñad (3.1.9) the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further\nexplained:\neño ’ëur ätmä cetasä veditavyo\nyasmin präëaù païcadhä saàviveça\npräëaiç cittaà sarvam otaà prajänäà\nyasmin viçuddhe vibhavaty eña ätmä\n“The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence.\nThis atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air (präëa, apäna, vyäna,\nsamäna and udäna), is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all\nover the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from\nthe contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is\nexhibited.”\nThe haöha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air\nencircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures—not for any\nmaterial profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of\nthe material atmosphere.\nSo the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures,\nand it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only\nthe insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading viñëu-tattva.\nThe influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body.\nAccording to the Muëòaka Upaniñad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart\nof every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is\nbeyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them\nassert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely\nthere in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily\nmovement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which\ncarry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul\npasses away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion,\nceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it\ncannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science,\nhowever, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.\nSuch atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine\nmolecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly,\nthe fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the\nSupreme Lord, called by the name prabhä, or superior energy. So whether one\nfollows Vedic knowledge or modern science, one cannot deny the existence of\nthe spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-gétä by the Personality of Godhead Himself.\n"

There is no\nchance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it\ncannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As\nmentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea\nhow to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of\nlamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the\nmaterial body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his\nwork, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the\nVedänta-sütras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and\nparcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the\nlight of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out\nof this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit\nsoul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was\nadvised to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material, bodily\nconsiderations."

        "PurPort": "Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one\nwith the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul\nis called the steady, or küöa-stha. The body is subject to six kinds of\ntransformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother’s body, remains\nfor some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last\nvanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes.\nThe soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes\nits birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die.\nAnything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth,\nhe therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and\nprimeval—that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under\nthe impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The\nsoul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man,\ntherefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth.\nThe changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate\nlike a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The\nby-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls;\nand, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body\ndevelops because of the soul’s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor\nchange. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.\nIn the Kaöha Upaniñad (1.2.18) we also find a similar passage, which reads:\nna jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcin\nnäyaà kutaçcin na babhüva kascit\najo nityaù çäçvato ’yaà puräëo\nna hanyate hanyamäne çarére\n [Bg. 2.20]\nThe meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-gétä,\nbut here in this verse there is one special word, vipaçcit, which means learned\nor with knowledge.\nThe soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore,\nconsciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul\nwithin the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of\nthe soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the\nsun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the\nsun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon\nas there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that\nthe sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all\nbodies—whether man or animal—we can understand the presence of the soul.\nThis consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of\nthe Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge—past,\npresent and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be\nforgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and\nenlightenment from the superior lessons of Kåñëa. But Kåñëa is not like the\nforgetful soul. If so, Kåñëa’s teachings of Bhagavad-gétä would be useless.\nThere are two kinds of souls—namely the minute particle soul (aëu-ätmä)\nand the Supersoul (vibhu-ätmä). This is also confirmed in the Kaöha Upaniñad\n(1.2.20) in this way:\naëor aëéyän mahato mahéyän\nätmäsya jantor nihito guhäyäm\ntam akratuù paçyati véta-çoko\ndhätuù prasädän mahimänam ätmanaù\n“Both the Supersoul [Paramätmä] and the atomic soul [jévätmä] are situated\non the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and\nonly one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations\ncan, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.” Kåñëa is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following\nchapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore\nhe requires to be enlightened by Kåñëa, or by His bona fide representative (the\nspiritual master)."

Although the justice of the peace awards capital\npunishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed, because he orders violence to another person according to\nthe codes of justice. In Manu-saàhitä, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported\nthat a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will\nnot have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king’s\npunishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when\nKåñëa orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme\njustice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such\nviolence, committed in the act of fighting for Kåñëa, is not violence at all\nbecause, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the\nadministration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation\nis not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be\nexecuted by Arjuna at the instruction of Kåñëa is with full knowledge, so there\nis no possibility of sinful reaction."

        "PurPort": "Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even the\nmodern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the\nsame time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept\ncontinuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and\nfrom boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the\nchange is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a\nprevious verse (2.13).\nTransference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible\nby the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic\nsoul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Muëòaka\nUpaniñad, as well as the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad, compare the soul and the\nSupersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the\nindividual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird\n(Kåñëa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds—although they are\nthe same in quality—one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while\nthe other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kåñëa is the\nwitnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one\nis still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this\nrelationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one’s changing his position from\none tree to another, or from one body to another. The jéva soul is struggling\nvery hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept\nthe other bird as the supreme spiritual master—as Arjuna agreed to do by\nvoluntary surrender unto Kåñëa for instruction—the subordinate bird\nimmediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Muëòaka Upaniñad\n(3.1.2) and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (4.7) confirm this: amäne våkñe puruño nimagno\n’néçayä çocati muhyamänaù\njuñöaà yadä paçyaty anyam éçam\nasya mahimänam iti véta-çokaù\n“Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully\nengrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree.\nBut if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and\nknows His glories—at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.”\nArjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Kåñëa, and is\nunderstanding the Bhagavad-gétä from Him. And thus, hearing from Kåñëa, he\ncan understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.\nArjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change\nof his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their\nbodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all\nreactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the\nsacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily\nreactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for\nArjuna’s lamentation. "

Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are\nclassified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all\ndifferent types of material elements.

Nor\nwas it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Supreme Soul;\nrather, the individual souls are eternally separated parts of the Supreme Soul.\nBecause they are atomic individual souls eternally (sanätana), they are prone\nto be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the\nassociation of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a fire, although one in\nquality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire.

There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of\nsuperior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon\nthe authority of his mother. There is no source of understanding the identity\nof the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no\nsource of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words,\nthe soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is\nconsciousness and conscious—that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we\nhave to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul.\nAs eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the\ninfinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is\ninfinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never\nbecome equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThis concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the\nstability of the conception of the soul.

        "PurPort": "There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do\nnot believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord\nKåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä, it appears that such philosophers existed, and\nthey were known as the lokäyatikas and vaibhäñikas. Such philosophers\nmaintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of\nmaterial combination. The modern material scientist and materialist\nphilosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a\ncombination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms\ndevelop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of\nanthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo\nreligions—now becoming fashionable in America—are also adhering to this\nphilosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.\nEven if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul—as in the\nvaibhäñika philosophy—there would still have been no cause for lamentation.\nNo one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging\nhis prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific\nwarfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the\nenemy. According to the vaibhäñika philosophy, the so-called soul or ätmä\nvanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or he did\nnot believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According\nto this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter\nevery moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment,\nthere is no need to grieve for such incidents. If there were no rebirth for the\nsoul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected by sinful reactions\ndue to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, Kåñëa\nsarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahä-bähu, mighty-armed, because He, at\nleast, did not accept the theory of the vaibhäñikas, which leaves aside the Vedic\nwisdom. As a kñatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved\nhim to continue to follow its principles."

Nonbelievers in the existence\nof the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for\nargument’s sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for\nlamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material\nelements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of\nnonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated;\nfrom air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth\nbecomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take\nplace. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it\nis dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as\natoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in\ncourse of time things are manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference.\nThen what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation\nor in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage,\nthings are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain\nunmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not\nmake any real material difference.\nAnd if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä that\nthese material bodies are perishable in due course of time (antavanta ime\ndehäù) but that the soul is eternal (nityasyoktäù çarériëaù), then we must\nremember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the\nchanging of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of\nflying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can\nsee that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom\nencourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material\nbody. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the\nsoul or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for\nlamentation for loss of the body"

Perhaps they have no idea that one must think of the soul, and thus\nmake a solution to the material miseries.\nSome people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending\nlectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are\nmisguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without\ndistinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly\nunderstands the position of the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective\nfunctions and relationships and all other major and minor details.

But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the\nsubject matter of the soul, then one’s life is successful.\nThe easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is\nto accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gétä spoken by the greatest authority,\nLord Kåñëa, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a\ngreat deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones,\nbefore one is able to accept Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nKåñëa can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure\ndevotee and by no other way."

        "PurPort": "Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the\nmatter of good administration, is called kñatriya. Kñat means hurt. One who\ngives protection from harm is called kñatriya (träyate—to give protection). The\nkñatriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A kñatriya would go into the\nforest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword.\nWhen the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation.\nThis system has been followed even up to the present day by the kñatriya kings\nof Jaipur state. The kñatriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing\nbecause religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, kñatriyas\nare never meant for accepting directly the order of sannyäsa, or renunciation.\nNonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or\nprinciple. In the religious law books it is stated:\nähaveñu mitho ’nyonyaà\njighäàsanto mahé-kñitaù\nyuddhamänäù paraà çaktyä\nsvargaà yänty aparäì-mukhäù\nyajïeñu paçavo brahman\nhanyante satataà dvijaiù\nsaàskåtäù kila mantraiç ca\nte ’pi svargam aväpnuvan\n“In the battlefield, a king or kñatriya, while fighting another king envious of\nhim, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brähmaëas\nalso attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire.\nTherefore, killing on the battlefield on religious principles and killing animals\nin the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because\neveryone is benefited by the religious principles involved. The animal\nsacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual\nevolutionary process from one form to another, and the kñatriyas killed on the\nbattlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brähmaëas who attain\nthem by offering sacrifice.\nThere are two kinds of sva-dharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not\nliberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance\nwith religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated,\none’s sva-dharma—specific duty—becomes spiritual and is not in the material\nbodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the\nbrähmaëas and kñatriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.\nSva-dharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth\nChapter. On the bodily plane sva-dharma is called varëäçrama-dharma, or\nman’s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins\nfrom the stage of varëäçrama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific\nmodes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one’s specific duty in any\nfield of action in accordance with the orders of higher authorities serves to\nelevate one to a higher status of life.”"

If he\nshould conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die\nin the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets, whose doors were\nwide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case."

        "PurPort": "According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, saìkhyä means that\nwhich describes things in detail, and säìkhya refers to that philosophy which\ndescribes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses.\nArjuna’s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his\nprime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing\nhis relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom\nafter conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhåtaräñöra. In both\nways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from\nconquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on\nthe basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.\nKåñëa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his\ngrandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all\nindividual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they\nwere individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will\ncontinue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual\nsouls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but\nactually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of\nmaterial dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very\ngraphically explained by Lord Kåñëa. And this descriptive knowledge of the\nsoul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as\nSäìkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This Säìkhya has nothing to do\nwith Säìkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter\nKapila’s Säìkhya, the Säìkhya philosophy was expounded in the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa,\nwho explained it to His mother, Devahüti. It is clearly explained by Him that\nthe puruña, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over\nthe prakåti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gétä. The description in\nthe Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakåti, or nature, and\nimpregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working\nin the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material\nenergy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the\nlast point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the\nLord. This is the last snare of mäyä, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is\nonly after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great\nsoul surrenders unto Väsudeva, Lord Kåñëa, thereby fulfilling the search afte \nthe ultimate truth.\nArjuna has already accepted Kåñëa as his spiritual master by surrendering\nhimself unto Him: çiñyas te ’haà çädhi mäà tväà prapannam. Consequently,\nKåñëa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or\nkarma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the\nsense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in\nChapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is\nsitting as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart. But such communion does not take\nplace without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional\nor transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the\nLord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in\ndevotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure\nknowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily\nin the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\nThus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of\nthe Lord, and the word Säìkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the\natheistic säìkhya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not,\ntherefore, misunderstand that the säìkhya-yoga mentioned herein has any\nconnection with the atheistic Säìkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any\ninfluence during that time; nor would Lord Kåñëa care to mention such godless\nphilosophical speculations. Real Säìkhya philosophy is described by Lord\nKapila in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, but even that Säìkhya has nothing to do\nwith the current topics. Here, Säìkhya means analytical description of the\nbody and the soul. Lord Kåñëa made an analytical description of the soul just\nto bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord\nKåñëa’s Säìkhya and Lord Kapila’s Säìkhya, as described in the Bhägavatam,\nare one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. Lord Kåñëa Said, therefore,\nthat only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between\nsäìkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga (säìkhya-yogau påthag bäläù pravadanti na\npaëòitäù).\nOf course, atheistic säìkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet\nthe unintelligent claim that the atheistic säìkhya-yoga is referred to in the\nBhagavad-getä.\nOne should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who\nworks for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may\nbe, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in\ntranscendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all\ntranscendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and\nthus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous\nendeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in\nKåñëa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of\nsense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material\nhappiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that\nwe perform."

Further? there is no chance of any harm coming out of it. In the case of medical treatment great harm will result from the doctors injudicious treatment if he uses a wrong medicine. But it is not so in the case of Karma Yoga. Anything done? however little it may be? in this path of Yoga? the Yoga of action? saves one from great fear of being caught in the wheel of birth and death. Lord Krishna here extols Karma Yoga in order to create interest in Arjuna in this Yoga.",
        "PurPort": "Activity in Kåñëa consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Kåñëa without\nexpectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of\nwork. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can\nthat small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material\nplane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But\nany work begun in Kåñëa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though\nnot finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his\nwork in Kåñëa consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in Kåñëa\nconsciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the\npoint of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent\nsuccess there is no profit. Ajämila performed his duty in some percentage of\nKåñëa consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred\npercent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.17):\ntyaktvä sva-dharmaà caraëämbujaà harer\nbhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi\nyatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià\nko värtha äpto ’bhajatäà sva-dharmataù\n“If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in Kåñëa\nconsciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work,\nwhat loss is there on his part? And what can one gain if one performs his\nmaterial activities perfectly?” Or, as the Christians say, “What profiteth a man\nif he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?”\nMaterial activities and their results end with the body. But work in Kåñëa\nconsciousness carries a person again to Kåñëa consciousness, even after the loss\nof the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born\nagain as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured brähmaëa or in\na rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation.That is the unique quality of work done in Kåñëa consciousness."

        "PurPort": "A strong faith that by Kåñëa consciousness one will be elevated to the\nhighest perfection of life is called vyavasäyätmikä intelligence. The\nCaitanya-caritämåta (Madhya 22.62) states:\n’çraddhä’-çabde——viçväsa kahe sudåòha niçcaya\nkrsna bhakti kaile sarva-karma kåta haya\nFaith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged\nin the duties of Kåñëa consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the\nmaterial world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality.\nFruitive activities are the engagements of one’s reactions from past good or bad\ndeeds. When one is awake in Kåñëa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor\nfor good results in his activities. When one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness,\nall activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to\ndualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Kåñëa consciousness is\nrenunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically\nachieved by progressive Kåñëa consciousness.\nThe resolute purpose of a person in Kåñëa consciousness is based on\nknowledge. Väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù: a person in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that Väsudeva, or\nKåñëa, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree\none automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in\nKåñëa consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone—namely\nself, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If Kåñëa is satisfied by one’s\nactions, then everyone will be satisfied.\nService in Kåñëa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able\nguidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kåñëa, who\nknows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. As such, to be well versed in Kåñëa consciousness one has to act\nfirmly and obey the representative of Kåñëa, and one should accept the\ninstruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one’s mission in life. Çréla\nViçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the\nspiritual master, as follows:\nyasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädo\nyasyäprasädän na gatiù kuto ’pi\ndhyäyan stuvaàs tasya yaças tri-sandhyaà\nvande guroù çré-caraëäravindam\n“By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kåñëa consciousness. I should,\ntherefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my\nrespectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.”\nThe whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul\nbeyond the conception of the body—not theoretically but practically, when\nthere is no longer a chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive\nactivities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of\nfruitive acts."

        "PurPort": "The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-käëòa division of the\nVedic literature are meant to encourage gradual development of\nself-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the\nFifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15): the purpose of studying the\nVedas is to know Lord Kåñëa, the primeval cause of everything. So,\nself-realization means understanding Kåñëa and one’s eternal relationship with\nHim. The relationship of the living entities with Kåñëa is also mentioned in\nthe Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä (15.7). The living entities are parts and\nparcels of Kåñëa; therefore, revival of Kåñëa consciousness by the individual\nliving entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is\nconfirmed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.33.7) as follows:\naho bata çva-paco ’to garéyän\nyaj-jihvägre vartate näma tubhyam\ntepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä\nbrahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te\n“O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a\nlow family like that of a caëòäla [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform\nof self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances\nand sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures\nmany, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage.\nSuch a person is considered to be the best of the Äryan family.\nSo one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas,\nwithout being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated\nto the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not\npossible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations\nof the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of the Vedänta and the\nUpaniñads thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources\nto execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The\nbest purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of\nthe Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls.\nWhen Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakäçänanda\nSarasvaté, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a\nsentimentalist instead of studying Vedänta philosophy, the Lord replied that\nHis spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to\nchant the holy name of Lord Kåñëa. He did so, and became ecstatic like a\nmadman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not\nadequately educated to understand Vedänta philosophy; the best purpose of\nVedänta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the\nLord. Vedänta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of\nthe Vedänta philosophy is Lord Kåñëa; and the highest Vedäntist is the great\nsoul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the\nultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism."

Work\nwith results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not\nauspicious. Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties,\nbut should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory\nduties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.\nArjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty\nwithout attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another\nside of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation.\nAny attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful.\nTherefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of\nsalvation for Arjuna"

        "PurPort": "Kåñëa tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga. And what is that yoga? Yoga\nmeans to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the\never-disturbing senses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord.\nAnd because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do\nwith the results of the fight. Gain or victory are Kåñëa’s concern; Arjuna is\nsimply advised to act according to the dictation of Kåñëa. The following of\nKåñëa’s dictation is real yoga, and this is practiced in the process called Kåñëa\nconsciousness. By Kåñëa consciousness only can one give up the sense of\nproprietorship. One has to become the servant of Kåñëa, or the servant of the\nservant of Kåñëa. That is the right way to discharge duty in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, which alone can help one to act in yoga.\nArjuna is a kñatriya, and as such he is participating in the\nvarëäçrama-dharma institution. It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa that in the\nvarëäçrama-dharma, the whole aim is to satisfy Viñëu. No one should satisfy\nhimself, as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy Kåñëa. So\nunless one satisfies Kåñëa, one cannot correctly observe the principles of\nvarëäçrama-dharma. Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as Kåñëa told him."

If\none can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord\nKåñëa, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as\nrecommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood\nthat the purpose of the Vedas is to reach Kåñëa and simply engages in the\nrituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements.

He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully Kåñëa conscious\nperson is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he\naccepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of\nmore trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the\ngrace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he\ngives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he\nrealizes that it is due only to the Lord’s grace that he is in such a comfortable\ncondition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of\nthe Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment\nor aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one’s own sense\ngratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But\none fixed in Kåñëa consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment\nbecause his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not\nat all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a\nKåñëa conscious person is always steady in his determination."

He is not disturbed by tumultuous sounds and noises of any description. Even on the battlefield he can rest in his centre? the Self? by withdrawing his senses.

        "PurPort": "The test of a yogé, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control\nthe senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the\nsenses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer\nto the question as to how the yogé is situated. The senses are compared to\nvenomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The\nyogé, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents—like a snake\ncharmer. He never allows them to act independently. There are many\ninjunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not’s, and some of\nthem are do’s. Unless one is able to follow the do’s and the do-not’s, restricting\noneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at\nany moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for\nparticular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the Kåñëa conscious persons are\nused only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are\nwithdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being taught here to use his senses for the\nservice of the Lord, instead of for his own satisfaction. Keeping the senses\nalways in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the\ntortoise, who keeps the senses within."

Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like\nañöäìga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära,\ndhäraëä, dhyäna, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no\nbetter knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord\nKåñëa, in the course of his advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, no longer has\na taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less\nintelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions\nare only good until one actually has a taste for Kåñëa consciousness. When one\nis actually Kåñëa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things."

And, of course, there are so many\nsimilar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to\ncontrol the mind and senses without being fully Kåñëa conscious. Without\nengaging the mind in Kåñëa, one cannot cease such material engagements.

It is as if a hungry man\nhad satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables.\nMahäräja Ambaréña also conquered a great yogé, Durväsä Muni, simply because\nhis mind was engaged in Kåñëa consciousness (sa vai manaù\nkåñëa-pädäravindayor vacäàsi vaikuëöha-guëänuvarëane)."

On the\nother hand, the king, although not as powerful a yogé as the sage, but a devotee\nof the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s injustices and thereby emerged\nvictorious. The king was able to control his senses because of the following\nqualifications, as mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (9.4.18–20):\nsa vai manaù kåñëa-pädäravindayor\nvacäàsi vaikuëöha-guëänuvarëane\nkarau harer mandira-märjanädiñu\nçrutià cakäräcyuta-sat-kathodaye\nmukunda-liìgälaya-darçane dåçau\ntad-bhåtya-gätra-sparçe ’ìga-saìgamam\nghräëaà ca tat-päda-saroja-saurabhe\nçrémat-tulasyä rasanäà tad-arpite\npädau hareù kñetra-padänusarpaëe\nçiro håñékeça-padäbhivandane\nkämaà ca däsye na tu käma-kämyayä\nyathottama-çloka-janäçrayä ratiù\n“King Ambaréña fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, engaged his\nwords in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of\nthe Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the\nform of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in\nsmelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his\ntongue in tasting the tulasé leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the\nholy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto\nthe Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord... and all these\nqualifications made him fit to become a mat-para devotee of the Lord.”\nThe word mat-para is most significant in this connection. How one can\nbecome mat-para is described in the life of Mahäräja Ambaréña. Çréla Baladeva\nVidyäbhüñaëa, a great scholar and äcärya in the line of the mat-para, remarks,\nmad-bhakti-prabhävena sarvendriya-vijaya-pürvikä svätma-dåñöiù sulabheti\nbhävaù. “The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of\ndevotional service to Kåñëa.” Also, the example of fire is sometimes given: “As\na blazing fire burns everything within a room, Lord Viñëu, situated in the\nheart of the yogé, burns up all kinds of impurities.” The Yoga-sütra also\nprescribes meditation on Viñëu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called\nyogés who meditate on something which is not on the Viñëu platform simply\nwaste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be\nKåñëa conscious—devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of\nthe real yoga"

Lord Çiva was deep in\nmeditation, but when Pärvaté agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the\nproposal, and as a result Kärtikeya was born. When Haridäsa Öhäkura was a\nyoung devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of\nMäyä-devé, but Haridäsa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed\ndevotion to Lord Kåñëa. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of Çré\nYämunäcärya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense\nenjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of\nthe Lord. That is the secret of success.

Their so-called renunciation is called phalgu, or less\nimportant. On the other hand, a person in Kåñëa consciousness knows how to\nuse everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a\nvictim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord,\nor the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries\nto avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kåñëa is the supreme enjoyer and\nthat He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good\neatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasädam. Thus\neverything becomes spiritualized, and there is no danger of a downfall. The\ndevotee takes prasädam in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee\nrejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his\nartificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls\nhim down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul,\neven though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not\nhaving support in devotional service."

One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because\nKåñëa is the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the\nsatisfaction of Kåñëa. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense\nsatisfaction, but when he became fully Kåñëa conscious he fought because\nKåñëa wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for\nKåñëa the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire\nfor the satisfaction of Kåñëa, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The\nliving entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the\nquality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that\neverything belongs to Kåñëa (éçäväsyam idaà sarvam), and therefore he does\nnot falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge\nis based on self-realization—namely, knowing perfectly well that every living\nentity is an eternal part and parcel of Kåñëa in spiritual identity, and that the\neternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of Kåñëa or\ngreater than Him. This understanding of Kåñëa consciousness is the basic\nprinciple of real peace."

It is needless to say that he who gets establised in Brahman throughout his life attains to the state of Brahman or,BrahmaNirvana (Cf.VIII.5?6).Maharshi Vidyaranya says in his Panchadasi that Antakala here means the moment at which Avidya or mutual superimposition of the Self and the notSelf ends.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the second discourse entitledThe Sankhya Yoga.,",
        "PurPort": "One can attain Kåñëa consciousness or divine life at once, within a\nsecond—or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births.\nIt is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Khaöväìga\nMahäräja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by\nsurrendering unto Kåñëa. Nirväëa means ending the process of materialistic\nlife. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion\nof this material life, but Bhagavad-gétä teaches differently. Actual life begins\nafter the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is\nsufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for\npersons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this\nmaterialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Kåñëa\nconscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirväëa. There is no\ndifference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the\nLord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the\ntranscendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual\nkingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification,\nwhereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Kåñëa consciousness.\nAttainment of Kåñëa consciousness even during this life is immediate\nattainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Kåñëa consciousness has\ncertainly already entered into the kingdom of God.\nBrahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore brähmé sthiti means “not\non the platform of material activities.” Devotional service of the Lord is\naccepted in the Bhagavad-gétä as the liberated stage (sa guëän samatétyaitän\nbrahma-bhüyäya kalpate). Therefore, brähmé sthiti is liberation from material\nbondage.\nsrila Bhaktivinoda Thikura has summarized this Second Chapter of the\nBhagavad-gétä as being the contents for the whole text.

Jnana Yoga takes the aspirant directly to the goal without any extraneous help. (Cf.V.5).",
        "PurPort": "In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of\nprocedures—namely säìkhya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this\nverse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. Säìkhya-yoga, or the analytical\nstudy of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who\nare inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge\nand philosophy. The other class of men work in Kåñëa consciousness, as it is\nexplained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained,\nalso in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or\nKåñëa consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and,\nfurthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly\nexplained in the 61st verse—that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the\nSupreme (or more specifically, on Kåñëa), and in this way all the senses can be\nbrought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are\ninterdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is\nsentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is\nmental speculation. The ultimate goal is Kåñëa, because the philosophers who\nare also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Kåñëa\nconsciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä. The whole process is to\nunderstand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The\nindirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may\ncome to the point of Kåñëa consciousness; and the other process is directly\nconnecting with everything in Kåñëa consciousness. Of these two, the path of\nKåñëa consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the\nsenses by a philosophical process. Kåñëa consciousness is itself the purifying\nprocess, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously\neasy and sublime."

As such, the spirit\nsoul has to be engaged in the good work of Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise it\nwill be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with\nmaterial energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul\nfrom such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined\nin the çästras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kåñëa\nconsciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.17) affirms this:\ntyaktvä sva-dharmam caraëämbujam harer\nbhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi\nyatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià\nko värtha äpto ’bhajatäà sva-dharmataù\n“If someone takes to Kåñëa consciousness, even though he may not follow\nthe prescribed duties in the çästras or execute the devotional service properly,\nand even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil\nfor him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the çästras,\nwhat does it avail him if he is not Kåñëa conscious?” So the purificatory process\nis necessary for reaching this point of Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore,\nsannyäsa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of\nbecoming Kåñëa conscious, without which everything is considered a failure."

Therefore,\none has to work in Kåñëa consciousness to satisfy Kåñëa (or Viñëu); and while\nperforming such activities one is in a liberated stage.

Nothing should be\nperformed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the\nsatisfaction of Kåñëa.

The Vedic principles are to help us\nunderstand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä: vedaiç ca\nsarvair aham eva vedyaù. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to\nunderstand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: patià viçvasyätmeçvaram.\nTherefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Viñëu. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also (2.4.20) Çréla Çukadeva\nGosvämé describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:\nçriyaù patir yajïa-patiù prajä-patih\ndhiyäm patir loka-patir dharä-patih\npatir gatiç cändhaka-våñëi-sätvatäà\nprasédatäà me bhagavän satäà patiù\nThe prajä-pati is Lord Viñëu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all\nworlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this\nmaterial world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajïas\n(sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Viñëu, so that while in the material world\nthey can live very comfortably without anxiety and after finishing the present\nmaterial body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole\nprogram for the conditioned soul. By performance of yajïa, the conditioned\nsouls gradually become Kåñëa conscious and become godly in all respects. In\nthe Age of Kali, the saìkértana-yajïa (the chanting of the names of God) is\nrecommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was\nintroduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age.\nSaìkértana-yajïa and Kåñëa consciousness go well together. Lord Kåñëa in His\ndevotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam\n(11.5.32) as follows, with special reference to the saìkértana-yajïa:\nkåñëa-varëaà tviñäkåñëaà\nsäìgopäìgästra-pärñadam\nyajïaiù saìkértana-präyair\nyajanti hi su-medhasaù\n“In this Age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence\nwill worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance\nof saìkértana-yajïa.” Other yajïas prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not\neasy to perform in this Age of Kali, but the saìkértana-yajïa is easy and\nsublime for all purposes, as recommended in Bhagavad-gétä also (9.14)."

It is stated also in the Bhagavad-gétä that Kåñëa\nHimself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yajïas: bhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäm.\nTherefore, ultimate satisfaction of the yajïa-pati is the chief purpose of all\nyajïas. When these yajïas are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in\ncharge of the different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no\nscarcity in the supply of natural products.\nPerformance of yajïas has many side benefits, ultimately leading to\nliberation from material bondage. By performance of yajïas, all activities\nbecome purified, as it is stated in the Vedas: ähära-çuddhau sattva-çuddhiù\nsattva-çuddhau dhruvä småtiù småti-lambhe sarvagranthénäà vipramokñaù. By\nperformance of yajïa one’s eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified\nfoodstuffs one’s very existence becomes purified; by the purification of\nexistence finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is\nsanctified one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined\ntogether lead to Kåñëa consciousness, the great necessity of present-day\nsociety."

He is really a dacoit of the property of the gods.",
        "PurPort": "The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Viñëu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the\nperformance of prescribed yajïas. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of\nyajïas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered\nto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what\nthe Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended.\nAccording to the different material qualities of the persons concerned,\ndifferent types of yajïas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different\ndemigods is also on the same basis—namely, according to different qualities.\nFor example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kälé,\nthe ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of\nanimals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the\ntranscendental worship of Viñëu is recommended. But ultimately all yajïas are\nmeant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary\nmen, at least five yajïas, known as païca-mahä-yajïa, are necessary.\nOne should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human\nsociety requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can\nmanufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society.\nThese eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the\npersons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like\nmeats, none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for\nexample heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life—none of\nthem can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord,\nthere can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without\nwhich no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the\nLord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw\nmaterials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials—all\nof which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we\nshould make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the\npurpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely,\nliberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained\nby performance of yajïas. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply\ntake supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become\nmore and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of\ncreation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the\nlaws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they\nhave no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life.\nThey are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of\nhow to perform yajïas. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest\nperformance of yajïa, namely the saìkértana-yajïa, which can be performed by\nanyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kåñëa consciousness."

The Supreme Lord,\nwho is known as the yajïa-puruña, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices,\nis the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the\nbody serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra and Varuëa are appointed\nofficers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy\nthese demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water\nsufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord Kåñëa is worshiped, the\ndemigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically\nworshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For\nthis reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in Kåñëa consciousness, offer\nfood to Kåñëa and then eat—a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By\nsuch action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the\nbody becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there\nis an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack\nof such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viñëu and then taken by\nus makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is\naccustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person\nin Kåñëa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kåñëa, can counteract all\nreactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of\nself-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to\nincrease the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to\nresemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The\nmaterial world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by\naccepting prasädam of the Lord (food offered to Viñëu) is saved from the\nattack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\nFood grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats\ndifferent kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the \nrefuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who\nare accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of\nvegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to\ndepend on the production of the field and not on the production of big\nfactories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such\nrains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all\nservants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one\nwho cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity—that is the law of\nnature. Yajïa, specifically the saìkértana-yajïa prescribed for this age, must\ntherefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply."

If we have to work for the satisfaction of\nthe yajïa-puruña, Viñëu, then we must find out the direction of work in\nBrahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of\nworking directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is\ncalled vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always\ntake direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one\nhas to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to\nwork under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the\nVedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. It is said, asya mahato bhütasya niçvasitam etad yad åg-vedo\nyajur-vedaù sämavedo ’tharväìgirasaù. “The four Vedas—namely the Åg Veda,\nYajur Veda, Säma Veda, and Atharva Veda—are all emanations from the\nbreathing of the great Personality of Godhead.” (Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad\n4.5.11) The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, for as it is\nconfirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä, the Lord has the omnipotence to perform\nthrough each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the\nLord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In\nfact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living\nentities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb\nof material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such\nconditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always\nremember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for\nmaterial enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy\none’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called\nenjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation;\ntherefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yajïa by\nbecoming Kåñëa conscious. Even those who have not followed the Vedic\ninjunctions may adopt the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, and that will take\nthe place of performance of Vedic yajïas, or karmas."

The prosperity of the\nworld depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of\nthe Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods.

Without\nsuch power, one cannot imitate the éçvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord Çiva\ndrank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man\ntries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many\npseudo devotees of Lord Çiva who want to indulge in smoking gaïjä\n(marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the\nacts of Lord Çiva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some\npseudo devotees of Lord Kåñëa who prefer to imitate the Lord in His räsa-lélä,\nor dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best,\ntherefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their\ninstructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification.\nThere are so many “incarnations” of God without the power of the Supreme\nGodhead."

According to\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam, one who knows the Absolute Truth in three different\nfeatures—namely Brahman, Paramätmä, and the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead—is called tattva-vit, for he knows also his own factual position in\nrelationship with the Supreme."

        "PurPort": "This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord\ninstructs that one has to become fully Kåñëa conscious to discharge duties, as if\nin military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult;\nnevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on Kåñëa, because\nthat is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot\nbe happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord, because the\neternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to\nthe desires of the Lord. Arjuna was therefore ordered by Çré Kåñëa to fight as if\nthe Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the\ngood will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed\nduties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the\norder of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the\nsoul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme\nSoul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully Kåñëa\nconscious, is called adhyätma-cetas. Niräçéù means that one has to act on the\norder of the master but should not expect fruitive results. The cashier may\ncount millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for\nhimself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any\nindividual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is\nthe real purport of mayi, or “unto Me.” And when one acts in such Kåñëa\nconsciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This\nconsciousness is called nirmama, or “nothing is mine.” And if there is any\nreluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without consideration of\nso-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown\noff; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or\nlethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type\nof work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation."

But those who are not in such consciousness\nshould follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures.

For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the\nconditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage\nties. According to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex\nrelationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to\nbe considered as one’s mother. But in spite of such injunctions, a man is still\ninclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to\nbe curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the\nmaterial body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should\nnot rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and\nregulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratification under\nregulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as there is always the\nchance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very\ncarefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even\non the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long,\nlong time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense\nenjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment\nfor regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But\nattachment to Kåñëa consciousness, or acting always in the loving service of\nKåñëa, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities.

For the duty of another has its pitfalls. The duty of a Kshatriya is to fight in a righteous battle. Arjuna must fight. This is his duty.

Duties on the spiritual platform and\nduties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following\nthe authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under\nthe spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed\nrules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a\nbrähmaëa, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a kñatriya,\nwho is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a kñatriya it\nis better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a\nbrähmaëa who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse\nhis heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends\nthe modes of material nature and is fully situated in Kåñëa consciousness, he\ncan perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide\nspiritual master. In that complete stage of Kåñëa consciousness, the kñatriya\nmay act as a brähmaëa, or a brähmaëa may act as a kñatriya. In the\ntranscendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For\nexample, Viçvämitra was originally a kñatriya, but later on he acted as a\nbrähmaëa, whereas Paraçuräma was a brähmaëa but later on he acted as a\nkñatriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is\non the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of\nmaterial nature.

This material creation is\ncreated by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these\nlustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful\nactivities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\nThis inquiry is the beginning of the Vedänta-sütras, wherein it is said,\nathäto brahma jijïäsä: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme\nis defined in Çrémad-Bhägavatam as janmädy asya yato ’nvayäd itarataç ca, or,\n“The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.” Therefore the origin of\nlust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the\nSupreme, or transformed into Kåñëa consciousness—or, in other words,\ndesiring everything for Kåñëa—then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized.\nHanumän, the great servitor of Lord Räma, exhibited his wrath by burning the\ngolden city of Rävaëa, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the\nLord. Here also, in Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath\nupon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath,\nwhen they are employed in Kåñëa consciousness, become our friends instead of\nour enemies."

        "PurPort": "There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure\nconsciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different\nmanifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about\nthe embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of\nthe living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living\nentity exhibits his Kåñëa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire\ncovered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no\novert manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of\nKåñëa consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of\nthe mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to\nchant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an\nanalogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless\nthat he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to\nthat of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in\nsuch a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost\nvoid of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and\nbeasts, and the smoke-covered fire is compared to the human being. In the\nform of a human being, the living entity may revive a little Kåñëa\nconsciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life\ncan be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in\nthe fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a\nchance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence.\nIn the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of\nKåñëa consciousness under able guidance."

Jïäna refers to knowledge of\nself as distinguished from non-self, or in other words, knowledge that the spirit\nsoul is not the body. Vijïäna refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul’s\nconstitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is\nexplained thus in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.9.31):\njïänaà parama-guhyaà me\nyad vijïäna-samanvitam\nsa-rahasyaà tad-aìgaà ca\ngåhäëa gaditaà mayä\n“The knowledge of the self and Supreme Self is very confidential and\nmysterious, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if\nexplained with their various aspects by the Lord Himself.” Bhagavad-gétä gives\nus that general and specific knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts\nand parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord.\nThis consciousness is called Kåñëa consciousness. So, from the very beginning\nof life one has to learn this Kåñëa consciousness, and thereby one may become\nfully Kåñëa conscious and act accordingly.\nLust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for\nevery living entity. But if one is educated in Kåñëa consciousness from the very\nbeginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of\nGod deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition.\nNonetheless, Kåñëa consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can\nbecome a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional\nservice. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its\nurgency, one can begin regulating the senses in Kåñëa consciousness,\ndevotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead—the\nhighest perfectional stage of human life"

        "PurPort": "The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved\nwithin the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses\nare superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is\nsuperior consciousness, or Kåñëa consciousness. In Kåñëa consciousness the\nsoul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead;\ntherefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends\nin the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and\nstopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is\nactive, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will\nact—as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of\nthe intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the\nsoul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates,\nnamely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In\nthe Kaöha Upaniñad there is a similar passage, in which it is said that the\nobjects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to\nthe sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of\nthe Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become\nengaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. paraà\ndåñövä nivartate. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the\nLord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the\nKatha Upanishad the soul has been described as mahän, the great. Therefore the\nsoul is above all—namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the\nintelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of\nthe soul is the solution of the whole problem.\nWith intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul\nand then engage the mind always in Kåñëa consciousness. That solves the\nwhole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from\nthe objects of the senses. But aside from that, one has to strengthen the mind\nby use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one’s mind in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though\nthe senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than\nserpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of\nintelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by\nassociation with Kåñëa in Kåñëa consciousness, there is every chance of falling\ndown due to the agitated mind."

The kings of all planets are especially meant for the protection of the\ninhabitants, and therefore the royal order should understand the science of\nBhagavad-gétä in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from\nmaterial bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual\nknowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nand the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this\nlesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the\nexecutive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kåñëa\nconsciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and\npursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.\nIn this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasvän, the king of the sun,\nwhich is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the\nBrahma-saàhitä (5.52) it is stated:\nyac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà\nräjä samasta-sura-mürtir açeña-tejäù\nyasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakro\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\n“Let me worship,” Lord Brahmä said, “the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nGovinda [Kåñëa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun,\nwhich is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun\nrepresents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His\norder.”\nThe sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name\nVivasvän) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by\nsupplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of Kåñëa, and Lord\nKåñëa originally made Vivasvän His first disciple to understand the science of\nBhagavad-gétä. The Gétä is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the\ninsignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming \ndown from time immemorial.\nIn the Mahäbhärata (Çänti-parva 348.51–52) we can trace out the history of\nthe Gétä as follows:\ntretä-yugädau ca tato\nvivasvän manave dadau\nmanuç ca loka-bhåty-arthaà\nsutäyekñväkave dadau\nikñväkuëä ca kathito\nvyäpya lokän avasthitaù\n“In the beginning of the millennium known as Tretä-yuga this science of\nthe relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvän to Manu. Manu,\nbeing the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahäräja Ikñväku, the king of\nthis earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord\nRämacandra appeared.” Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä existed in human society\nfrom the time of Mahäräja Ikñväku.\nAt the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of\nthe Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dväpara-yuga\n(800,000 years), and before that there was Tretä-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus,\nsome 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gétä to his disciple and son\nMahäräja Iksväku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu\nis calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed.\nAccepting that before the birth of Manu the Gétä was spoken by the Lord to\nHis disciple the sun-god Vivasvän, a rough estimate is that the Gétä was spoken\nat least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two\nmillion years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand\nyears ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the Gétä, according to\nthe Gétä itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Çré Kåñëa. It\nwas spoken to the sun-god Vivasvän because he is also a kñatriya and is the\nfather of all kñatriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the sürya-vaàça\nkñatriyas. Because Bhagavad-gétä is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruñeya, superhuman.\nSince the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human \ninterpretation, the Gétä must therefore be accepted without mundane\ninterpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gétä in their\nown ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gétä as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä has to\nbe accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein\nthat the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu and\nManu spoke to his son Iksväku."

        "PurPort": "It is clearly stated that the Gétä was especially meant for the saintly kings\nbecause they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly\nBhagavad-gétä was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate\nits value for no one’s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations\naccording to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by\nthe motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to\nreestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by\nthe Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He\ndeclared that the purpose of the Gétä appeared to be lost. In the same way, at\nthe present moment also there are so many editions of the Gétä (especially in\nEnglish), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic\nsuccession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different\nmundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa, although they make a good business on the\nwords of Çré Kåñëa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in\nGod but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need\nof an edition of the Gétä in English, as it is received by the paramparä\n(disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great\nwant. Bhagavad-gétä—accepted as it is—is a great boon to humanity; but if it is\naccepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time."

        "PurPort": "Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe\nKåñëa’s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for\nthose who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the\ndemons who do not like the idea that Kåñëa should be accepted as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he\nwere himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kåñëa. As it will be\nevident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kåñëa is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last\nword in transcendence. Of course, Kåñëa also appeared as the son of Devaké on\nthis earth. How Kåñëa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nthe eternal original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand.\nTherefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before Kåñëa so that\nHe Himself could speak authoritatively. That Kåñëa is the supreme authority is\naccepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial,\nand the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since Kåñëa is the authority\naccepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that Kåñëa would\ndescribe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to\ndistort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is\nnecessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Kåñëa.\nTherefore, when Kåñëa Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all\nthe worlds. To the demons, such explanations by Kåñëa Himself may appear to\nbe strange because the demons always study Kåñëa from their own standpoint,\nbut those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Kåñëa when\nthey are spoken by Kåñëa Himself. The devotees will always worship such\nauthoritative statements of Kåñëa because they are always eager to know more\nand more about Him. The atheists, who consider Kåñëa an ordinary man, may\nin this way come to know that Kåñëa is superhuman, that He is\nsac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]—the eternal form of bliss and\nknowledge—that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination\nof the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A\ndevotee of Kåñëa, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of\nthe transcendental position of Kåñëa. Arjuna’s putting this question before the\nLord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of\npersons who consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being, subject to the\nmodes of material nature"

        "PurPort": "In the Brahma-saàhitä (5.33) we have information of many, many\nincarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:\nadvaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam\nädyaà puräëa-puruñaà nava-yauvanaà ca\nvedeñu durlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\n“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kåñëa], who is\nthe original person—absolute, infallible, without beginning. Although\nexpanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the\nperson always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing\nforms of the Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they\nare always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.”\nIt is also stated in Brahma-saàhitä (5.39):\nrämädi-mürtiñu kalä-niyamena tiñöhan\nnänävatäram akarod bhuvaneñu kintu\nkåñëaù svayaà samabhavat paramaù pumän yo\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\n“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kåñëa], who is\nalways situated in various incarnations such as Räma, Nåsiàha and many\nsubincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known\nas Kåñëa, and who incarnates personally also.”\nIn the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second,\nmanifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya stone, which\nchanges color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the\npure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas (vedeñu\ndurlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau). Devotees like Arjuna are constant\ncompanions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate\ndevotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities.\nArjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some\nmillions of years ago when Lord Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god\nVivasvän, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference\nbetween the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident\nwhereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the\npart-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is\naddressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is\nunable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a\nliving entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never\nequal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is\ncertainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is\ndescribed in the Brahma-saàhitä as infallible (acyuta), which means that He\nnever forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the\nLord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living\nentity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he\nsometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can\nat once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee\nor a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these\ndescriptions in the Gétä cannot be understood by demonic brains. Kåñëa\nremembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but\nArjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kåñëa and Arjuna are eternal in\nnature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to\nhis change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His\nsac-cid-änanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction\nbetween His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is\nspirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And\nbecause the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different\nfrom that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material\nplatform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature\nof the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.\n"

If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same\ntime one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer\nimmediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was\ndoing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim\nto be God, or Kåñëa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims.\nThen again, the Lord explains His prakåti, or His form. Prakåti means “nature,”\nas well as svarüpa, or “one’s own form.” The Lord says that He appears in His\nown body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes\nfrom one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in\nthe present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material\nworld, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to\nanother. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so\nin the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, Kåñëa\nappears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands,\nholding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by\nthis material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and\nis Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary\nliving entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body,\nit still appears that Lord Kåñëa grows from childhood to boyhood and from\nboyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At\nthe time of the Battle of Kurukñetra, He had many grandchildren at home; or,\nin other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He\nlooked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a\npicture of Kåñëa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is\nthe oldest person in the whole creation—past, present, and future. Neither His\nbody nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear\nthat in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal\nform of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and\nintelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance is like the sun’s\nrising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the\nsun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our\neyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its\nfixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the\nappearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord Kåñëa’s\nappearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any\nordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful\nknowledge by His internal potency—and He is never contaminated by\nmaterial nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in\nmultimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that\neven though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change\nof body. In the Bhägavatam, He appears before His mother as Näräyaëa, with\nfour hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences.

A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the\nqualifications of Kåñëa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood\nto be a sädhu. And duñkåtäm applies to those who do not care for Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Such miscreants, or duñkåtäm, are described as foolish and the\nlowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane\neducation, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is accepted as a sädhu, even though such a person may be\nneither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is\nnot necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He\ndid with the demons Rävaëa and Kaàsa. The Lord has many agents who are\nquite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to\nappease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The\ndemon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin.\nAlthough Prahläda Mahäräja was the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, he was\nnonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa,\nwas the sister of Kaàsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only\nbecause Kåñëa was to be born of them. So Lord Kåñëa appeared primarily to\ndeliver Devaké, rather than kill Kaàsa, but both were performed\nsimultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and\nvanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\nIn the Caitanya-caritämåta of Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja, the following verses\n(Madhya 20.263–264) summarize these principles of incarnation:\nsåñöi-hetu yei mürti prapaïce avatare\nsei éçvara-mürti ‘avatära’ näma dhare\nmäyätéta paravyome sabära avasthäna\nviçve avatari’ dhare ‘avatära’ näma\n“The avatära, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of\nGod for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of\nGodhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avatära. Such\nincarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When\nthey descend to the material creation, they assume the name avatära.”\nThere are various kinds of avatäras, such as puruñävatäras, guëävatäras,\nlélävatäras, çakty-äveça avatäras, manvantara-avatäras and yugävatäras—all\nappearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord Kåñëa is the primeval\nLord, the fountainhead of all avatäras. Lord Çré Kåñëa descends for the specific\npurpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious\nto see Him in His original Våndävana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose\nof the Kåñëa avatära is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.\nThe Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This\nindicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the\nSrimad-Bhägavatam, the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya\nMahäprabhu, who spread the worship of Kåñëa by the saìkértana movement\n(congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread Kåñëa consciousness\nthroughout India. He predicted that this culture of saìkértana would be\nbroadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord\nCaitanya as the incarnation of Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, is described\nsecretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures,\nsuch as the Upaniñads, Mahäbhärata and Bhägavatam. The devotees of Lord\nKåñëa are very much attracted by the saìkértana movement of Lord Caitanya.\nThis avatära of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by His\ncauseless mercy."

His body is Chinmaya (full of consciousness? not inert matter as are human bodies composed of the five elements).",
        "PurPort": "The Lord’s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in\nthe 6th verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the\nPersonality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and\ntherefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this\npresent material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material\nbondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yogés attain liberation\nonly after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they\nachieve—merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord—is only\npartial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the\ndevotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and\nactivities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and\ndoes not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the\nBrahma-saàhitä (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and\nincarnations: advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam. Although there are\nmany transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with\nconviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric\nphilosophers. As stated in the Vedas (Puruña-bodhiné Upaniñad):\neko devo nitya-lélänurakto\nbhakta-vyäpé hådy antar-ätmä\n“The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many,\nmany transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.” This\nVedic version is confirmed in this verse of the Gétä personally by the Lord. He\nwho accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical\nspeculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by\naccepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The\nVedic version tat tvam asi is actually applied in this case. Anyone who\nunderstands Lord Kåñëa to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord “You\nare the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,” is certainly\nliberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental\nassociation of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of\nthe Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic\nassertion\ntam eva viditväti måtyum eti\nnänyaù panthä vidyate ’yanäya\n“One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply\nby knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no\nother way to achieve this perfection.” (Svetäsvatara Upanisa 3.8) That there\nis no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord Kåñëa as\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and\nconsequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, by licking the\nouter surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-gétä\naccording to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume\nvery important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible\nfor liberation. Such puffed-up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless\nmercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate Kåñëa\nconsciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection."

(Cf.II.56IV.19to37).",
        "PurPort": "As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially\naffected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth.\nGenerally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so\nabsorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand\nhow the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that\nthere is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and\neternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of\nignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this\nsame bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the\nLord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material\nmanifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be\nimpersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of\nretaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When\nthey are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they\nbecome afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind\nof merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living\nentities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the\nhighest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual\npersonality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge\nof spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot\nunderstand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories\nand by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they\nbecome disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme\ncause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased\ncondition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not\ngive attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme\nspiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all\nsorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to\nthe shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are\nsometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of\nattachment to the material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual\npersonal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in\nlife. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has\nto take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master,\nand follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last\nstage of the devotional life is called bhäva, or transcendental love of Godhead.\nAccording to Bhakti-rasämrta-sindhu (1.4.15–16), the science of devotional\nservice:\nädau çraddhä tataù sädhusaìgo ’tha bhajana-kriyä\ntato ’nartha-nivåttiù syät\ntato niñöhä rucis tataù\nathäsaktis tato bhävas\ntataù premäbhyudaïcati\nsädhakänäm ayaà premëaù\nprädurbhäve bhavet kramah\n“In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization.\nThis will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are\nspiritually elevated. In the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated\nspiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the\nprocess of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the\nguidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material\nattachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for\nhearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. This taste leads\none further forward to attachment for Kåñëa consciousness, which is matured\nin bhäva, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for\nGod is called prema, the highest perfectional stage of life.” In the prema stage\nthere is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.\nSo, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona\nfide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all\nmaterial attachment, from the fearfulness of one’s individual spiritual\npersonality, and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one\ncan ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord"

        "PurPort": "Everyone is searching for Kåñëa in the different aspects of His\nmanifestations. Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially\nrealized in His impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading\nSupersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But\nKåñëa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kåñëa is the\nobject of everyone’s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied\naccording to one’s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, Kåñëa\nreciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the\ndevotee wants Him. One devotee may want Kåñëa as supreme master, another\nas his personal friend, another as his son, and still another as his lover. Kåñëa\nrewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love\nfor Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there,\nand they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of\nworshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode\nassociate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the\nLord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those\nwho are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by\nannihilating the individual existence of the living entity, Kåñëa helps also by\nabsorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept\nthe eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish\nthe bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished\ntheir individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the\nimpersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant\ndesires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they\nare again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are\nfruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties,\nas the yajïeçvara; and those who are yogés seeking mystic powers are awarded\nsuch powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy\nalone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on\nthe same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of Kåñëa\nconsciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam (2.3.10):\nakämaù sarva-kämo vä\nmokña-käma udära-dhéù\ntévreëa bhakti-yogena\nyajeta puruñaà param\n“Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is\ndesirous of all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts\ntry to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection,\nculminating in Kåñëa consciousness.”\n"

Actually, the\ndemigods are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and\nparcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo\nnityänäm: God is one. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù. The Supreme God is\none—Kåñëa—and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this\nmaterial world. These demigods are all living entities (nityänäm) with different\ngrades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme\nGod—Näräyaëa, Viñëu, or Kåñëa. Anyone who thinks that God and the\ndemigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or päñaëòé. Even the great\ndemigods like Brahmä and Çiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In\nfact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahmä and Çiva\n(çiva-viriïci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who\nare worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of\nanthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devatäù denotes a powerful man or\ndemigod of this material world. But Näräyaëa, Viñëu, or Kåñëa, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or\ntranscendental to, material creation. Even Sripäda sakaräcärya, the leader of\nthe impersonalists, maintains that Näräyaëa, or Kåñëa, is beyond this material\ncreation. However, foolish people (hrta-jnäna) worship the demigods because\nthey want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results\nso obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The\nintelligent person is in Kåñëa consciousness, and he has no need to worship the\npaltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this\nmaterial world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of\nthis material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary.\nBoth the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and\ntheir worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however,\nhuman society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of\npossessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such\ntemporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human\nsociety. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a\npolitical leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are\ntherefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or “big guns” in order to achieve\ntemporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are\nnot interested in Kåñëa consciousness for the permanent solution to the\nhardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get\na little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered\nliving entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely\ninterested in Kåñëa consciousness. They are mostly interested in material\nenjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity."

The mercantile men, called the vaiçyas, are situated in the mixed\nmodes of passion and ignorance, and the çüdras, or laborer class, are situated in\nthe ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four\ndivisions of human society, Lord Kåñëa does not belong to any of these\ndivisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom\nform human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but\nto elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are\ncreated by the Lord for the systematic development of Kåñëa consciousness.\nThe tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of\nmaterial nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the\ndifferent modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of\nthis book. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, however, is above even the\nbrähmaëas. Although brähmaëas by quality are supposed to know about\nBrahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the\nimpersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Kåñëa. But a man who transcends\nthe limited knowledge of a brähmaëa and reaches the knowledge of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, becomes a person in Kåñëa\nconsciousness—or, in other words, a Vaiñëava. Kåñëa consciousness includes\nknowledge of all different plenary expansions of Kåñëa, namely Räma,\nNåsiàha, Varäha, etc. And as Kåñëa is transcendental to this system of the\nfour divisions of human society, a person in Kåñëa consciousness is also\ntranscendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the\ndivisions of community, nation or species."

        "PurPort": "As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king\ncan do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the\nLord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the\nactivities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the\ncreation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of\nmaterial activities because of their propensity for lording it over material\nresources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right\nand wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves\nresponsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of\nsense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For\nadvancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work\nof this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord,\nbeing full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The\nheavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires\nthe low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the\nmaterial actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for\ndifferent types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such\nrains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic småti confirms this fact\nas follows:\nnimitta-mätram eväsau\nsåjyänäà sarga-karmaëi\npradhäna-käraëé-bhütä\nyato vai såjya-çaktayaù\n“In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The\nimmediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made\nvisible.” The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods,\nhuman beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions\nof their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper\nfacilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He\nis never responsible for their past and present activities. In the Vedänta-sütra\n(2.1.34) it is confirmed, vaiñamya-nairghåëye na säpekñatvät: the Lord is never\npartial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts.\nThe Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the\nexternal energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this\nlaw of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of\nhis activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental\nnature of the Lord is an experienced man in Kåñëa consciousness, and thus he\nis never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the\ntranscendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the\nLord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living\nentities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions. But one\nwho knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in Kåñëa consciousness."

        "PurPort": "There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material\nthings within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kåñëa\nconsciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full\nof dirty things can take to the line of Kåñëa consciousness for a gradual\ncleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service.\nThose who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the\nsame Kåñëa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities\nand thereby be benefited. Foolish persons or neophytes in Kåñëa consciousness\noften want to retire from activities without having knowledge of Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Arjuna’s desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was\nnot approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the\nactivities of Kåñëa consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Kåñëa\nconsciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities\nfor the sake of Kåñëa. Arjuna is here advised to act in Kåñëa consciousness,\nfollowing in the footsteps of the Lord’s previous disciples, such as the sun-god\nVivasvän, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past\nactivities, as well as those of persons who acted in Kåñëa consciousness in the\npast. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art\nfrom the Lord some millions of years before.

Why such action should not be independent will be explained in the\ntext to follow.\nTo act in Kåñëa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of\nauthorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the\nbeginning of this chapter. The system of Kåñëa consciousness was first\nnarrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu\nexplained it to his son Ikñväku, and the system is current on this earth from\nthat very remote time.

Otherwise even the most\nintelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of Kåñëa\nconsciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in Kåñëa\nconsciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna,\nanyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.\nIt is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect\nexperimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid\ndown by the Lord Himself. Dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam (Bhäg.\n6.3.19). No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation.\nOne must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahmä, Çiva,\nNärada, Manu, the Kumäras, Kapila, Prahläda, Bhéñma, Çukadeva Gosvämé,\nYamaräja, Janaka, and Bali Mahäräja. By mental speculation one cannot\nascertain what is religion or self-realization.

If you stand as s spectator or silent witness of Natures activities? feeling Nature does everything I am nondoer (Akarta)? if you identify yourself with the actionless Self? no matter what work or how much of it is done? action is no action at all.

The restless mind will ever be doing actions even though one sits ietly. Actions of the mind are real actions. Nor can anyone even for one moment remain really actionless? for helplessly is everyone driven to action by the alities of Nature. (Chapter III.5)Inaction also induces the feeling of egoism.

Just as a seed burnt in the fire cannot germinate? so also the Karmas or actions burnt by the fire of knowledge of the Self cannot produce future birth.Ordinary people think that the sage is also a doer of actions? an agent? active and therefore bound? when they see him doing actions. This is a mistake. From his own point of view and? in truth? he is not an agent at all. He really does no action at all. He feels and says? I do nothing at all. Nature does or the three alities of Nature do everything.He is not affected by heat and cold? pleasure and pain? success and failure? as he always has a balanced state of mind. He is not attached even to the things which are necessary for the bare maintenance of his body. He experiences neither pleasure nor pain? whether or not he obtains food and the other things which are reired for the maintenance of his body. The reason is that he is resting in his essential nature as ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute (SatchidanandaSvarupa) he is swimming in the ocean of bliss. So he does not care for his body and its needs.",
        "PurPort": "A Kåñëa conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain\nhis body. He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord. He\nneither begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is\nsatisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor. He is therefore\nindependent in his livelihood. He does not allow anyone’s service to hamper\nhis own service in Kåñëa consciousness. However, for the service of the Lord\nhe can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality\nof the material world. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat\nand cold, or misery and happiness. A Kåñëa conscious person is above duality\nbecause he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of Kåñëa.\nTherefore he is steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible\nwhen one is fully in transcendental knowledge."

        "PurPort": "How activities in Kåñëa consciousness can lead one ultimately to the\nspiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But,\nfor the present, just the principle of Kåñëa consciousness is described. A\nconditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the\nmaterial atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The\nprocess by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere\nis Kåñëa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder\nof the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk\nproduct, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured\nby Kåñëa consciousness as set forth here in the Gétä. This process is generally\nknown as yajïa, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of\nViñëu, or Kåñëa. The more the activities of the material world are performed\nin Kåñëa consciousness, or for Viñëu only, the more the atmosphere becomes\nspiritualized by complete absorption. The word brahma (Brahman) means\n“spiritual.” The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are\ncalled brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in\nthat brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by illusion (mäyä) or sense\ngratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by\nKåñëa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kåñëa consciousness, the\nconsuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of\nconsumption, the contributor, and the result are—all combined\ntogether—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by\nmäyä is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth\nregains its spiritual quality. Kåñëa consciousness is the process of converting\nthe illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is\nfully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, it is said to be in samädhi, or trance.\nAnything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajïa, or\nsacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the\ncontributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the\nperformance, and the result or ultimate gain—everything—becomes one in\nthe Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of Kåñëa\nconsciousness"

The second Yajna is JnanaYajna or the wisdom sacrifice performed by those who are devoted to Jnana Yoga. The oblation in this sacrifice is the Self. Yajna here means the Self. The Upadhis or the limiting adjuncts such as the physical body? the mind? the intellect? etc.? which are superimposed on Brahman through ignorance are sublated and the identity of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul or Brahman is realised. To sacrifice the self in Brahman is to know through direct cognition (Aparoksha Anubhuti) that the individual soul is identical with Brahman. This is the highest Yajna. Those who are established in Brahman? those who have realised their oneness with the Supreme Soul or Paramatma perform this kind of sacrifice. This is superior to all other sacrifices.",
        "PurPort": "As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is also called a perfect yogé or a first-class mystic. But there are\nothers also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still\nothers who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the\nSupreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different\ncategories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of\nperformers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factually sacrifice\nmeans to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viñëu, who is also known as Yajïa. All the\ndifferent varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions:\nnamely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of\ntranscendental knowledge. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness sacrifice all\nmaterial possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others,\nwho want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material\npossessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who\nare impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of\nimpersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by\nthe Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material\nfunctions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who\nare interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices\naccording to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-éçvara-vädé, or believers in\nmany gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute\nTruth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their\nindividual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences\nby merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice\ntheir time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental\nnature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their\nmaterial possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist\nsacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence\nof the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme\nBrahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman.\nThe Kåñëa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for\nthe satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus all his material possessions as well as his\nown self—everything—is sacrificed for Kåñëa. Thus, he is the first-class yogé;\nbut he does not lose his individual existence."

        "PurPort": "The members of the four divisions of human life, namely the brahmacäré,\nthe gåhastha, the vänaprastha and the sannyäsé, are all meant to become perfect\nyogés or transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying\nsense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so\narranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmacärés, or\nstudents under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by\nabstaining from sense gratification. A brahmacäré hears only words concerning\nKåñëa consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and\ntherefore the pure brahmacäré engages fully in harer\nnämänukértanam—chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains\nhimself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in\nthe transcendental sound vibration of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa. Similarly, the\nhouseholders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts\nwith great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general\ntendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in\nunrestricted sex life and other sense gratification. Marriage on the principles\nof religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that\nis the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a\nkind of yajïa because the restricted householder sacrifices his general\ntendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life."

As long\nas the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called paräg-ätmä, but as soon as\nthe same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called\npratyag-ätmä. The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work\nwithin the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The\nPataïjali system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the\nbody’s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air\nwithin become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment.\nAccording to this yoga system, pratyag-ätmä is the ultimate goal. This\npratyag-ätmä is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with\nthe sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling,\ntongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in\nactivities outside the self. They are called the functions of the präëa-väyu. The\napäna-väyu goes downwards, vyäna-väyu acts to shrink and expand,\nsamäna-väyu adjusts equilibrium, udäna-väyu goes upwards—and when one is\nenlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization."

All of these processes are recommended for\ncontrolling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This\npractice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the\ndirections of their passage. The apäna air goes downward, and the präëa air\ngoes up. The präëäyäma-yogé practices breathing the opposite way until the\ncurrents are neutralized into püraka. equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath\ninto the inhaled breath is called recaka. When both air currents are completely\nstopped, one is said to be in kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga. one\ncan increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization.

A Kåñëa conscious person, however, being always\nsituated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically\nbecomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the\nservice of Kåñëa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the\nend of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord\nKåñëa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at\nonce raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (14.26):\nmäà ca yo ’vyabhicäreëa\nbhakti-yogena sevate\nsa guëän samatétyaitän\nbrahma-bhüyäya kalpate\n“One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord transcends\nthe modes of material nature and is immediately elevated to the spiritual\nplatform.” A Kåñëa conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and\nhe is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and\nultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of\nreduced eating is automatically done when one eats only kåñëa-prasädam, or\nfood which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very\nhelpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no\npossibility of getting out of the material entanglement."

Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence;\ntherefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense\ngratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of\nfull knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the eternal\natmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help\none to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this\nadvancement in life, not only does one become happy and opulent in this life,\nbut also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging\ninto the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Kåñëa."

        "PurPort": "Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of\nhis real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the\nmultiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and\nsinful life is the cause of one’s dragging on in material existence. The human\nform of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this\nentanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing\nout the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and,\nat last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of\nreligion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically\nsolves our economic problems. By performance of yajïa we can have enough\nfood, enough milk, etc.—even if there is a so-called increase of population.\nWhen the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the\nsenses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense\ngratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from\nmaterial bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate\nwith the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yajïa\n(sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform\nyajïa according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life even in this body,\nand what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different\ngrades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there\nis immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajïa. But the\nhighest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the\nspiritual planets by practice of Kåñëa consciousness. A life of Kåñëa\nconsciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material\nexistence."

The Lord is the\noriginal spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey\nthe message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually\nrealized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish\npretenders.

Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress\nin spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the\nknowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and\none should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false\nprestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of\nadvancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper\ncombination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and\nservice, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One\nmust be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the\ngenuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with\ngenuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd\ninquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the\nspiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in\nsubmission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature\nvery kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is\nalways ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries\nbecomes perfect.\n"

        "PurPort": "The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who\nknows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa. The sense of an\nexistence separate from Kåñëa is called mäyä (mä—not, yä—this). Some think\nthat we have nothing to do with Kåñëa, that Kåñëa is only a great historical\npersonality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is\nstated in the Bhagavad-gétä, this impersonal Brahman is the personal\neffulgence of Kåñëa. Kåñëa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the\ncause of everything. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is clearly stated that Kåñëa is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of\nincarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities\nare also expansions of Kåñëa. The Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that\nKåñëa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought\nis material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing,\nwhen fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the\nMäyävädé philosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus\none is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the\ncase in the absolute world.\nFor want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now\ncovered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kåñëa.\nAlthough we are separated parts of Kåñëa, we are nevertheless not different\nfrom Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is mäyä, or not actual\nfact. We are all meant to satisfy Kåñëa. By mäyä alone Arjuna thought that the\ntemporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his\neternal spiritual relationship with Kåñëa. The whole teaching of the Gétä is\ntargeted toward this end: that a living being, as Kåñëa’s eternal servitor,\ncannot be separated from Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from\nKåñëa is called mäyä. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the\nSupreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose since time\nimmemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods,\netc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental\nservice of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service\nthrough Kåñëa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion.\nOne can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master\nand thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to Kåñëa. Perfect\nknowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, is the supreme shelter for all living\nentities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the\nmaterial energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under\ndifferent standards of material identity, they become forgetful of Kåñëa.\nWhen, however, such deluded living entities become situated in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as\nconfirmed in the Bhägavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa\nvyavasthitiù. Liberation means to be situated in one’s constitutional position as\nan eternal servitor of Kåñëa (Kåñëa consciousness)."

        "PurPort": "The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called sanätana-yoga, or\neternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of\nsacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one’s material possessions, and the\nother is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of\none’s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such\nsacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a\nspiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we\ncome to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two:\nnamely, understanding of one’s own self (or one’s constitutional position), and\nthe truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the\npath of Bhagavad-gétä as it is can very easily understand these two important\ndivisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining\nperfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such\nunderstanding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the\ntranscendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the\ntranscendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord\nHimself. One who does not understand the instructions of the Gétä is faithless,\nand is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded\nto him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand\nthe real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of\nGodhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual\nacceptance of the principles of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is\nawakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to\nBrahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in\npracticing mystic yoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in\nstudying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution called\nvarëäçrama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are\nbased on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor\nis self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of\nBhagavad-gétä, but one who doubts the authority of Kåñëa falls back. One is\ntherefore advised to study Bhagavad-gétä, or any other scripture, under a bona\nfide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is\nin the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all\nfrom the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of\nyears ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä have\ncome down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of\nBhagavad-gétä as it is expressed in the Gétä itself and beware of self-interested\npeople after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path.\nThe Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are\ntranscendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very\nbeginning of his study of Bhagavad-gétä.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge."

        "PurPort": "In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that work in\ndevotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is\neasier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one\nfrom reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and\nits entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this\nmaterial encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained\ntherein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated\non the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the\nFourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work\nculminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord\nadvised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge.\nTherefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in\ndevotion and inaction in knowledge, Kåñëa has perplexed Arjuna and\nconfused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in\nknowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities.\nBut if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In\nother words, he thinks that sannyäsa, or renunciation in knowledge, should be\naltogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation\nappear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that\nwork in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction.\nHe inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether or work with\nfull knowledge."

        "PurPort": "Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material\nbondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the\nstandard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of\nbodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. Çrémad-Bhägavatam\n(5.5.4–6) confirms this as follows:\nnünaà pramattaù kurute vikarma\nyad indriya-prétaya äpåëoti\nna sädhu manye yata ätmano ’yam\nasann api kleça-da äsa dehaù\nparäbhavas tävad abodha-jäto\nyävan na jijïäsata ätma-tattvam\nyävat kriyäs tävad idaà mano vai\nkarmätmakaà yena çaréra-bandhaù\nevaà manaù karma-vaçaà prayuìkte\navidyayätmany upadhéyamäne\nprétir na yävan mayi väsudeve\nna mucyate deha-yogena tävat\n“People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this\npresent body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one’s fruitive activities in\nthe past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in\nmany ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is\nconsidered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real\nidentity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for\nfruitive results for sense gratification, and as long as one is engrossed in the\nconsciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to\nanother. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and\ninfluenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to\nVäsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage\nof material existence.”\nTherefore, jïäna (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit\nsoul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul,\notherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities\nperformed in full knowledge strengthen one’s advancement in real knowledge.\nWithout Kåñëa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not\nactually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not\npurified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kåñëa\nconsciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so\nthat one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore action in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of\nfalling. Renunciation without Kåñëa consciousness is incomplete, as is\nconfirmed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.258):\npräpaïcikatayä buddhyä\nhari-sambandhi-vastunaù\nmumukñubhiù parityägo\nvairägyaà phalgu kathyate\n“When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their\nrenunciation is called incomplete.” Renunciation is complete when it is in the\nknowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one\nshould claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that,\nfactually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of\nrenunciation? One who knows that everything is Kåñëa’s property is always\nsituated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to Kåñëa, everything should\nbe employed in the service of Kåñëa. This perfect form of action in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a\nsannyäsé of the Mäyävädé school."

        "PurPort": "The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of\nlife. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference\nbetween the conclusions reached by the two processes. By Säìkhya\nphilosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a\npart and parcel of the material world but of the supreme spirit whole.\nConsequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his\nactions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process,\nSäìkhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga\nprocess one has to attach himself to the work of Kåñëa consciousness.\nFactually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process\nappears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve\nattachment. Detachment from matter and attachment to Kåñëa are one and\nthe same. One who can see this sees things as they are."

The\nMäyävädé sannyäsés also study the Vedänta-sütras, but use their own\ncommentary, called Çäréraka-bhäñya, written by Çaìkaräcärya. The students of\nthe Bhägavata school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord,\naccording to päïcarätriké regulations, and therefore the Vaiñëava sannyäsés\nhave multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The\nVaiñëava sannyäsés have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they\nperform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the\nMäyävädé sannyäsés, engaged in the studies of Säìkhya and Vedänta and\nspeculation, cannot relish the transcendental service of the Lord. Because\ntheir studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman\nspeculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhägavatam without proper\nunderstanding. Consequently their study of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam becomes\ntroublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial\nmeans are all useless for the Mäyävädé sannyäsés. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés, who\nare engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their\ntranscendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into\nthe kingdom of God. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés sometimes fall down from the\npath of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a\nphilanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material\nengagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in\nKåñëa conscious activities are better situated than the sannyäsés engaged in\nsimple speculation about what is Brahman and what is not Brahman, although\nthey too come to Kåñëa consciousness, after many births."

Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of\ncontrolled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, “Why then was\nArjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn’t he in Kåñëa consciousness?”\nArjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained\nin the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would\ncontinue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one\nwas killed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Only their dresses were changed by\nthe order of Kåñëa, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while\nfighting on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, was not really fighting at all; he was\nsimply carrying out the orders of Kåñëa in full Kåñëa consciousness.

Somehow the superior nature,\nthe living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time\nimmemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains\nis the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in\nsuch a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the\nbody by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance\nacquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and\ndistress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the\nbody, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of\nbody, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor\nnor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the\nmaterial ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing\nhim, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the\nwater by transcendental Kåñëa consciousness. That alone will save him from\nall turmoil."

He attains freedom or Moksha when he identifies himself with the immortal? actionless Self that dwells within his heart.When I does not act how can God accept good or evil deeds (Cf.V.29)",
        "PurPort": "The Sanskrit word vibhu means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited\nknowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always\nsatisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not\ncreate a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,\nbewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and\nthereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior\nnature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by\nignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living\nentity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is aëu, or\natomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will.\nSuch desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living\nentity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires,\nbut the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular\nsituation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the\nembodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and\nbecomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is\nthe constant companion of the living entity as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul,\nand therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can\nsmell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of\nconditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves:\nMan proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent\nin fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord,\nbeing neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute\nindependent living entities. However, when one desires Kåñëa, the Lord takes\nspecial care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to\nHim and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, eña u hy eva\nsädhu karma kärayati taà yam ebhyo lokebhya unninéñate. eña u eväsädhu karma\nkärayati yam adho ninéñate: “The Lord engages the living entity in pious\nactivities so that he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious\nactivities so that he may go to hell.” (Kauñétaké Upaniñad 3.8)\najïo jantur anéço ’yam\nätmanaù sukha-duùkhayoù\néçvara-prerito gacchet\nsvargaà väçv abhram eva ca\n“The living entity is completely dependent in his distress and happiness. By\nthe will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the\nair.”\nTherefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Kåñëa\nconsciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is\nconstitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his\nexistence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is\nthus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living\nentity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The\nVedänta-sütras (2.1.34) also confirm this. Vaiñamya-nairghåëye na säpekñatvät\ntathä hi darçayati: “The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He\nappears to.”\n"

        "PurPort": "Those who have forgotten Kåñëa must certainly be bewildered, but those\nwho are in Kåñëa consciousness are not bewildered at all. It is stated in the\nBhagavad-gétä, sarvaà jïäna-plavena, jïänägniù sarva-karmäëi and na hi\njïänena sadåçam. Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that\nknowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Kåñëa, as\nis said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän\nmäà prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect\nin knowledge surrenders unto Kåñëa, or when one attains Kåñëa consciousness,\nthen everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the\ndaytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when\nhe unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of\nnescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by\nnescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience,\nor Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person\nwho is in perfect Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a\nbona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kåñëa consciousness is,\nfor Kåñëa consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun\ndrives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he\nis not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to\ndiscriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know\neverything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kåñëa\nconscious spiritual master. One can know God and one’s relationship with\nGod only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative\nof God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect\nordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the\ndistinction between God and the living entity. Lord Çré Kåñëa therefore stated\nin the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the\nLord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are\nindividuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future,\neven after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in\nday, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with\nindividuality in spiritual life is real knowledge."

This is due to their relationship to\nthe Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramätmä, is\npresent in everyone’s heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real\nknowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different\nspecies of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every\nliving being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Paramätmä regardless of the\ncircumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Paramätmä is present both in\nthe outcaste and in the brähmaëa, although the body of a brähmaëa and that\nof an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of\ndifferent modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the\nbody are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul\nand the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the\nindividual soul is present only in that particular body whereas the Paramätmä\nis present in each and every body. A Kåñëa conscious person has full\nknowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The\nsimilar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both\nconscious, eternal and blissful.

The eggs of the tortoise are laid\non land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly,\nthe devotee in Kåñëa consciousness, although far away from the Lord’s abode,\ncan elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly—by\nengagement in Kåñëa consciousness.

        "PurPort": "The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious\nto attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for\npeace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gétä. The greatest peace\nformula is simply this: Lord Kåñëa is the beneficiary in all human activities.\nMen should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because\nHe is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater\nthan He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Çiva and Lord\nBrahmä. In the Vedas (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.7) the Supreme Lord is\ndescribed as tam éçvaräëäà paramaà maheçvaraà. Under the spell of illusion,\nliving entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are\ndominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of\nmaterial nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of\nmaterial nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to\nachieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense\nof Kåñëa consciousness: Lord Kåñëa is the supreme predominator, and all living\nentities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain\nperfect peace only in complete Kåñëa consciousness.\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kåñëa consciousness,\ngenerally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how\nkarma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the\npredominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge.\nDirect Kåñëa consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and jïäna-yoga is a path leading to\nbhakti-yoga. Kåñëa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s\nrelationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this\nconsciousness is full knowledge of Kåñëa, or the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and\nparcel. He comes into contact with mäyä (illusion) due to the desire to lord it\nover mäyä, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in\ncontact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities.\nKåñëa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is\nwithin the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by\npractice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed\nfrom the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything\ndepends on one’s practical performance of duties in Kåñëa consciousness,\nwhich helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence\nof desire and anger. And one who stands fast in Kåñëa consciousness,\ncontrolling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the\ntranscendental stage, or brahma-nirväëa. The eightfold yoga mysticism is\nautomatically practiced in Kåñëa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is\nserved. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama,\näsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna and samädhi. But these only\npreface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the\nhuman being. It is the highest perfection of life.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in Kåñëa Consciousness."

        "PurPort": "In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga\nsystem is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very\ndifficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali.\nAlthough the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord\nemphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in Kåñëa consciousness, is\nbetter. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their\nparaphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal\ngratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to\nact in Kåñëa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work.\nTo act in Kåñëa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are\nconstitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work\nfor the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for\nself-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the\nliving entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for\npersonal satisfaction is the perfect sannyäsé, the perfect yogi.\nThe sannyäsés sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated\nfrom all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajïas\n(fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to\nbecome one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any\nmaterial desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogé\nwho practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material\nactivities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in\nKåñëa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without\nself-interest. A Kåñëa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His\ncriterion of success is the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus he is the perfect\nsannyäsé, or perfect yogé. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of\nrenunciation, prays in this way:\nna dhanaà na janaà na sundaréà\nkavitäà vä jagad-éça kämaye\nmama janmani janmanéçvare\nbhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi\n“O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy\nbeautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is\nthe causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.”"

No one can become a Karma Yogi who plans and schemes and expects fruits for his actions. No devotee of action who has not renounced the thought of the fruits of his actions can become a Yogi of steady mind. The thought of the fruits will certainly make the mind unsteady.Lord Krishna eulogises Karma Yoga here because it is the means or an external aid (Bahiranga Sadhana) to Dhyana Yoga. Karma Yoga is a steppingstone to Dhyana Yoga. It leads to the Yoga of Meditation in due course. In order to encourage the practice of Karna Yoga it is stated here that Karma Yoga is Sannyasa. (Cf.V.4)",
        "PurPort": "Real sannyäsa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional\nposition as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no\nseparate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme.\nWhen he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is\nKåñëa conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and\nnatural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases\nall material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory\nactivities. This is practiced by the yogés who restrain the senses from material\nattachment. But a person in Kåñëa consciousness has no opportunity to engage\nhis senses in anything which is not for the purpose of Kåñëa. Therefore, a\nKåñëa conscious person is simultaneously a sannyäsé and a yogé. The purpose of\nknowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the jïäna and yoga\nprocesses, is automatically served in Kåñëa consciousness. If one is unable to\ngive up the activities of his selfish nature, then jïäna and yoga are of no avail.\nThe real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be\nprepared to satisfy the Supreme. A Kåñëa conscious person has no desire for\nany kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the\nSupreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be\nengaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of\ninactivity. All purposes are perfectly served by the practice of Kåñëa\nconsciousness."

The beginning of the ladder\nis called the yogärurukñu stage, and the highest rung is called yogärüòha.\nConcerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter\ninto meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different\nsitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered\nfruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental\nequilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of\nmeditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.\nA Kåñëa conscious person, however, is situated from the beginning on the\nplatform of meditation because he always thinks of Kåñëa.

In material existence one is subjected to the influence of\nthe mind and the senses.

Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not\nbe attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned\nsoul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense\nobjects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes\nentangled in material existence.

Only then can one attain Selfrealisation surely and ickly. He who practises meditation by fits and starts and for a few minutes daily will not be able to achieve any tangible results in Yoga. The Yogic aspirant should be free from hope? desire and greed. Only then will he have a steady mind. Hope? desire and greed make the mind ever restless and turbulent. They are the enemies of peace and Selfknowledge. The aspirant should not have many possessions either. He can only keep those articles which are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of his body. If there are many possessions? the mind will be ever thinking of them and attempting to protect them.It you are well established in the practice of Pratyahara?

Sudden severance of worldly ties may produce intense mental agony in you and shock in them. You will have to break the ties gradually. Stay for a week or a month in seclusion to begin with. Then gradually prolong the period. They will not feel the pangs of separation from you.As your will has become very weak? as you had no religious discipline or training in schools and colleges when you were young? and as you are under the sway of materialistic influences? it is necessary for you to go in for seclusion for some days or weeks (during the Chritstmas? Easter or other holidays) to practise rigorous Japa and meditation and to develop your willpower.Those who have fixed up their sons in life and who have retired from service? and who have discharged their duties as householders can remain in seclusion for four or five years and practise intense meditation and Tapas (penance) for selfpurification and Selfrealisation. This is like entering a university for higher studies or postgraduate course of study. When the Tapas is over? and when they have attained to Selfknowledge? they should come out and share their knowledge of the Self with others through lectures? conversations? discourses or hearttoheart talks according to their capacity and disposition.How can sensecontrol be tested in a lonely forest where there are no temptations The Yogic student living in a cave should test himself after he has sufficiently advanced? by coming into the society of people. But he should not test himself every now and then like the man who removed the young plant daily after watering it to see whether it had struck deep root or not.",
        "PurPort": "Kåñëa is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Paramätmä and the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Kåñëa consciousness means, concisely, to be\nalways engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those\nwho are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are\nalso partially Kåñëa conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray\nof Kåñëa and Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of Kåñëa. Thus\nthe impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly Kåñëa conscious. A\ndirectly Kåñëa conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such\na devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and Paramätmä. His knowledge of\nthe Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative\nyogé are imperfectly Kåñëa conscious.\nNevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged\nin their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection\nsooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind\nalways on Kåñëa. One should always think of Kåñëa and not forget Him even\nfor a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called samädhi, or\ntrance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in\nseclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful\nto accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his\nrealization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after\nunnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.\nAll these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is\ndirectly in Kåñëa consciousness, because direct Kåñëa consciousness means\nself-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness.\nÇréla Rüpa Gosvämé characterizes Kåñëa consciousness in this way:\nanäsaktasya viñayän\nyathärham upayuïjataù\nnirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe\nyuktaà vairägyam ucyate\npräpaïcikatayä buddhyä\nhari-sambandhi-vastunaù\nmumukñubhiù parityägo\nvairägyaà phalgu kathyate\n“When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts\neverything in relation to Kåñëa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.\nOn the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its\nrelationship to Kåñëa is not as complete in his renunciation.”\n(Bhakti-rasämrta-sindhu 2.255–256)\nA Kåñëa conscious person well knows that everything belongs to Kåñëa, and\nthus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no\nhankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept\nthings in favor of Kåñëa consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to\nKåñëa consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is\nalways transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with\npersons not in Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore a person in Kåñëa consciousness\nis the perfect yoga"

Then it will be easy for you to check the wandering mind. When you sit for meditation? and when you deliberately attempt to forget the worldly objects? all sorts of worldly thoughts will crop up in your mind and disturb your meditation.

Through regular and constant meditation you can purify the subconscious mind and its constant memories. The fire of meditation will burn all thoughts. Be sure of this. Meditation is a potent antidote to annihilate the poisonous worldly thoughts. Be assured of this.Meditation on the immortal Self will act like a dynamite and blow up all thoughts and memories in the conscious mind. If the thoughts trouble you much? do not try to suppress them by force. Be a silent witness as in a bioscope. They will subside gradually. Then try to root them out through regual silent meditation.During introspection you can clearly observe the rapid shifting of the mind from one line of thought to another.

You can rearrange the thoughts and make new associations on a new Sattvic basis. You can throw out wordly and useless thoughts.

This is a stupendous task indeed. But for a Yogi of determination who has the grace of the Lord and an iron will it is nothing.Calm the bubbling emotions? sentiments? instincts and impulses gradually through silent meditation.

If the body is unsteady? the mind will also become unsteady. There is an intimate connection between the body and the mind.You should not shake the body even a bit. You should attain mastery over the Asana (AsanaJaya) by daily practice. You should be as firm as a statue or a rock.

This is an experience to give you encouragement? push you up in the spiritual path and convince you of the existence of transcendental or supraphysical things. Do not stop your Sadhana. Yogins and those Bhaktas who meditate on Lord Siva concentrate on the Ajna Chakra with the Bhrumadhya Drishti. You can select whichever Drishti suits you best.Though the gaze is directed towards the tip of the nose when the eyes are halfclosed and the eyalls are steady the mind should be fixed only on the self.

        "PurPort": "The goal of life is to know Kåñëa, who is situated within the heart of every\nliving being as Paramätmä, the four-handed Viñëu form.

One who has no program to realize this\nviñëu-mürti is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting\nhis time. Kåñëa is the ultimate goal of life, and the viñëu-mürti situated in one’s\nheart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this viñëu-mürti within the heart,\none has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to\nleave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned\nabove. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a\nso-called yoga class and thus become a yogé. One has to practice controlling the\nmind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief.\nIn the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yäjïavalkya it is said:\nkarmaëä manasä väcä\nsarvävasthäsu sarvadä\nsarvatra maithuna-tyägo\nbrahmacaryaà pracakñate\n“The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex\nindulgence in work, words and mind—at all times, under all circumstances,\nand in all places.” No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex\nindulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood, when one has\nno knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula,\nor the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the\nstrict discipline of becoming brahmacärés. Without such practice, no one can\nmake advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyäna, jïäna or bhakti. One\nwho, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual\nrelationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a\nbrahmacäré. Such a restrained householder brahmacäré may be accepted in the\nbhakti school, but the jïäna and dhyäna schools do not even admit householder\nbrahmacärés. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the\nbhakti school, a householder brahmacäré is allowed controlled sex life because\nthe cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual\nattraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the\nBhagavad-gétä (2.59) it is said:\nviñayä vinivartante\nnirähärasya dehinaù\nrasa-varjaà raso ’py asya\nparaà dåñövä nivartate\nWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a\ndevotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other\nthan the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.\nVigata-bhéù. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his\nforgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. The Bhägavatam (11.2.37)\nsays, bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo ’småtiù. Kåñëa\nconsciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is\npossible for a person who is Kåñëa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of\nyoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Kåñëa conscious person is already the\nbest of all yogés. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are\ndifferent from those of the popular so-called yoga societies."

One has to practice controlling the\nmind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief.\nIn the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yäjïavalkya it is said:\nkarmaëä manasä väcä\nsarvävasthäsu sarvadä\nsarvatra maithuna-tyägo\nbrahmacaryaà pracakñate\n“The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex\nindulgence in work, words and mind—at all times, under all circumstances,\nand in all places.” No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex\nindulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood, when one has\nno knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula,\nor the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the\nstrict discipline of becoming brahmacärés. Without such practice, no one can\nmake advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyäna, jïäna or bhakti. One\nwho, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual\nrelationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a\nbrahmacäré. Such a restrained householder brahmacäré may be accepted in the\nbhakti school, but the jïäna and dhyäna schools do not even admit householder\nbrahmacärés. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the\nbhakti school, a householder brahmacäré is allowed controlled sex life because\nthe cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual\nattraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the\nBhagavad-gétä (2.59) it is said:\nviñayä vinivartante\nnirähärasya dehinaù\nrasa-varjaà raso ’py asya\nparaà dåñövä nivartate\nWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a\ndevotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other\nthan the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.\nVigata-bhéù. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his\nforgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. The Bhägavatam (11.2.37)\nsays, bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo ’småtiù. Kåñëa\nconsciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is\npossible for a person who is Kåñëa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of\nyoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Kåñëa conscious person is already the\nbest of all yogés. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are\ndifferent from those of the popular so-called yoga societies."

        "PurPort": "The ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga practice\nis not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the\ncessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health\nor aspires after material perfection is no yogé according to Bhagavad-gétä. Nor\ndoes cessation of material existence entail one’s entering into “the void,”\nwhich is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the\nLord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the\nspiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly\ndescribed in the Bhagavad-gétä as that place where there is no need of sun,\nmoon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are\nself-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is\neverywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called paraà\ndhäma, or superior abodes.\nA consummate yogé, who is perfect in understanding Lord Kåñëa, as is\nclearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (mat-cittaù, mat-paraù,\nmat-sthänam), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme\nabode, Kåñëaloka, known as Goloka Våndävana. In the Brahma-saàhitä (5.37)\nit is clearly stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù: the Lord, although\nresiding always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and\nthe localized Paramätmä as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No\none can reach the spiritual sky (Vaikuëöha) or enter into the Lord’s eternal\nabode (Goloka Våndävana) without the proper understanding of Kåñëa and\nHis plenary expansion Viñëu. Therefore a person working in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is the perfect yogé, because his mind is always absorbed in\nKåñëa’s activities (sa vai manaù kåñëa-pädäravindayoù). In the Vedas also\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 3.8) we learn, tam eva viditväti måtyum eti: “One can\novercome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa.” In other words, perfection of the yoga system\nis the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical\njugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people."

The Kåñëa conscious person\nobserves fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat\nmore than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One\nwho eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must\nconsequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six\nhours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly\ninfluenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is\nlazy and prone to sleep a great deal.

        "PurPort": "Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and\nmating—which are demands of the body—can block advancement in the\npractice of yoga. As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when\none is practiced to take and accept prasädam, sanctified food. Lord Kåñëa is\noffered, according to the Bhagavad-gétä (9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits,\ngrains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in Kåñëa consciousness becomes\nautomatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption,\nor not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a Kåñëa\nconscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered\na great loss. Avyartha-kälatvam: [Cc.Madhya 23.18-19] a Kåñëa conscious\nperson cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the\nservice of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in\nthis respect is Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, who was always engaged in the service of\nKåñëa and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not\neven that. Öhäkura Haridäsa would not even accept prasädam nor even sleep\nfor a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads\nthree hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a Kåñëa conscious\nperson does not do anything which is not connected with Kåñëa’s interest, and\nthus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since\nthere is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work,\nspeech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material\nmisery for him"

All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a\npure devotee.”\nThis transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers\nof the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person\nin Kåñëa consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the\nengagements of Mahäräja Ambaréña. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet\nof the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are\nnot practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed\nactivities are called arcana, or engaging all the senses in the service of the\nLord. The senses and the mind require engagements.

Therefore, for people in general—especially those who are not in the\nrenounced order of life—transcendental engagement of the senses and the\nmind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement,\nwhich is called yukta in the Bhagavad-gétä."

        "PurPort": "By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts.\nThis is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one\nbecomes situated in trance, or samädhi, which means that the yogé realizes the\nSupersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the\nmisgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or\nless based on the principles of the Pataïjali system. Some unauthorized\ncommentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the\nmonists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real\npurpose of the Pataïjali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of\ntranscendental pleasure in the Pataïjali system, but the monists do not accept\nthis transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness.\nThe duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in\nthis verse transcendental pleasure—realized through transcendental\nsenses—is accepted. And this is corroborated by Pataïjali Muni, the famous\nexponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-sütras (3.34):\npuruñärtha-çünyänäà guëänäà pratiprasavaù kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä\nciti-çaktir iti.\nThis citi-çakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruñärtha means\nmaterial religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end,\nthe attempt to become one with the Supreme. This “oneness with the\nSupreme” is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pataïjali, this\nkaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity\nbecomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya,\nthis state of affairs is called ceto-darpaëa-märjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12], or\nclearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This “clearance” is actually\nliberation, or bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëam. The theory of nirväëa—also\npreliminary—corresponds with this principle. In the Bhägavatam (2.10.6) this\nis called svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù. The Bhagavad-gétä also confirms this situation\nin this verse.\nAfter nirväëa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual\nactivities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as Kåñëa consciousness. In\nthe words of the Bhägavatam, svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù: this is the “real life of the\nliving entity.” Mäyä, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated\nby material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean\ndestruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pataïjali also\naccepts this by his words kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä citi-çaktir iti. This\nciti-çakti, or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the\nVedänta-sütra (1.1.12) as änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät. This natural transcendental\npleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of\ndevotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga will be vividly described in the\nSeventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.\nIn the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of\nsamädhi, called samprajïäta-samädhi and asamprajïäta-samädhi. When one\nbecomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical\nresearches, he is said to have achieved samprajïäta-samädhi. In the\nasamprajïäta-samädhi there is no longer any connection with mundane\npleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from\nthe senses. When the yogé is once situated in that transcendental position, he\nis never shaken from it. Unless the yogé is able to reach this position, he is\nunsuccessful. Today’s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense\npleasures, is contradictory. A yogé indulging in sex and intoxication is a\nmockery. Even those yogés who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the\nprocess of yoga are not perfectly situated. If yogés are attracted by the\nby-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is\nstated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of\ngymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.\nThe best practice of yoga in this age is Kåñëa consciousness, which is not\nbaffling. A Kåñëa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does\nnot aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially\nin this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haöha-yoga, dhyäna-yoga and jïäna-yoga,\nbut there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.\nAs long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the\nbody, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in\npure bhakti-yoga, or in Kåñëa consciousness, does not arouse the senses while\nmeeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of\nlife, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness\nin Kåñëa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences—such as\naccidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative—but he\nis always alert to execute his duties in Kåñëa consciousness, or bhakti-yoga.\nAccidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä\n(2.14), ägamäpäyino ’nityäs täàs titikñasva bhärata. He endures all such\nincidental occurrences because he knows that they come and go and do not\naffect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga\npractice"

A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of\nthe ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow\nbecame very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not\neven consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She\nbegan to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for\nher impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last\nGaruòa, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Viñëu, heard it. He became\ncompassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow.\nGaruòa was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he\npromised to help. Thus Garuòa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest\nhe himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this,\nand returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuòa.\nSimilarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the\nprinciples with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps\nthose who help themselves."

The individual soul is also situated in the individual\nheart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the\nindividual soul and the Supersoul.

Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.\nOutwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As\nwill be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two\nenergies—the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living\nentity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior\nenergy; the living entity is always in the Lord’s energy. Every living entity is\nsituated in Him in one way or another.\nThe yogé sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in\ndifferent situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all\ncircumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the\nliving entity serves the material senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves\nthe Supreme Lord directly.

Such a person may appear to see all separate\nmanifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is\nconscious of Kåñëa, knowing that everything is a manifestation of Kåñëa’s\nenergy. Nothing can exist without Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the Lord of\neverything—this is the basic principle of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa\nconsciousness is the development of love of Kåñëa—a position transcendental\neven to material liberation. At this stage of Kåñëa consciousness, beyond\nself-realization, the devotee becomes one with Kåñëa in the sense that Kåñëa\nbecomes everything for the devotee and the devotee becomes full in loving\nKåñëa. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists.\nIn that stage, the living entity can never be annihilated, nor is the Personality\nof Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in Kåñëa is spiritual\nannihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä\n(5.38):\npremäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena\nsantaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti\nyaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\n“I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee\nwhose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form\nof Çyämasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.”\nAt this stage, Lord Kåñëa never disappears from the sight of the devotee,\nnor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a yogé who sees\nthe Lord as Paramätmä within the heart, the same applies. Such a yogé turns\ninto a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment without seeing the\nLord within himself."

The yogé should know that Viñëu is not different\nfrom Kåñëa. Kåñëa in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone’s heart.\nFurthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls\npresent in the innumerable hearts of living entities.

A devotee of the Lord, always\nacting in Kåñëa consciousness, is automatically liberated. In the\nNärada-païcarätra this is confirmed in this way:\ndik-kälädy-anavacchinne\nkåñëe ceto vidhäya ca\ntan-mayo bhavati kñipraà\njévo brahmaëi yojayet\n“By concentrating one’s attention on the transcendental form of Kåñëa,\nwho is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in\nthinking of Kåñëa and then attains the happy state of transcendental\nassociation with Him.”\nKåñëa consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This\nvery understanding that Kåñëa is present as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart\nmakes the yogé faultless. The Vedas (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.21) confirm this\ninconceivable potency of the Lord as follows: eko ’pi san bahudhä yo ’vabhäti.\n“Although the Lord is one, He is present in innumerable hearts as many.”\nSimilarly, in the småti-çästra it is said:\neka eva paro viñëuù\nsarva-vyäpé na saàçayaù\naiçvaryäd rüpam ekaà ca\nsürya-vat bahudheyate\n“Viñëu is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading.

The easiest way to control the mind, as\nsuggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting “Hare Kåñëa,” the great mantra for\ndeliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai manaù\nkåñëa-pädäravindayoù: one must engage one’s mind fully in Kåñëa. Only then\nwill there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind."

Commentary The constant or repeated effort to keep the wandering mind steady by constant meditation on the Lakshya (centre? ideal? goal or object of meditation) is Abhyasa or practice. The same idea or thought of the Self or God is constantly repeated. This constant repetition destroys Vikshepa or the vacillation of the mind and desires? and makes it steady and onepointed.Vairagya is dispassion or indifference to senseobjects in this world or in the other? here or hereafter? seen or unseen? heard or unheard? achieved through constantly looking into the evil in them (DoshaDrishti). You will have to train the mind by constant reflection on the immortal? allblissful Self. You must make the mind realise the transitory nature of the wordly enjoyments. You must suggest to the mind to look for its enjoyment not in the perishable and changing external objects but in the immortal? changeless Self within. Gradually the mind will be withdrawn from the external objects.",
        "PurPort": "The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is\naccepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that\nby practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present\nage no one can observe the strict rules and regulations of placing oneself in a\nsacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and\nmind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of Kåñëa\nconsciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the\nLord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about\nKåñëa. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of\nall misgivings. The more one hears about Kåñëa, the more one becomes\nenlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from\nKåñëa. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can\nvery easily learn vairägya. Vairägya means detachment from matter and\nengagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more\ndifficult than attaching the mind to the activities of Kåñëa. This is practical\nbecause by hearing about Kåñëa one becomes automatically attached to the\nSupreme Spirit. This attachment is called pareçänubhava, spiritual satisfaction.\nIt is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of\nfood he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction\nand strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels\ntranscendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material\nobjectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and\nappropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord Kåñëa is\ntherefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered\nto Kåñëa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the\nprocess of Kåñëa consciousness."

Trying to practice yoga while\nengaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while\npouring water on it. Yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time.\nSuch a show of yoga may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as\nspiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, one must control the mind by\nengaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless\none is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A\nKåñëa conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without\nseparate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without\nbecoming Kåñëa conscious."

        "PurPort": "The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-gétä.\nThe basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not\nthis material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in\neternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body\nand mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice\nof the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to\nrealize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with\nGod, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve\nthe highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Following any of the\nabove-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner\nor later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little\nendeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out\nof these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this\nage because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly\nassured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kåñëa to confirm His former statement. One\nmay sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation\nof knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very\ndifficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for\nmany reasons. First of all, one may not be sufficiently serious about following\nthe process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war\non the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the\nclutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various\nallurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material\nenergy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while\nperforming transcendental disciplines. This is called yogäc calita-mänasaù:\ndeviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the\nresults of deviation from the path of self-realization."

If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both\nways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual\nsuccess. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky\nsometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one.

A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all\nmaterial activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, Kåñëa\nconsciousness. One may argue that by Kåñëa consciousness one may attain the\nhighest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a\nperfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined\nin the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing\nprescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental\nactivities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bhägavatam\nassures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even\nthough he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing\nprescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kåñëa consciousness\nis never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is\nlowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly\nthe prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is\nlacking in Kåñëa consciousness.\nThe purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into\ntwo sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are\nengaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next\nlife or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who\nfollow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified\namongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and\nnoncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal\npropensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the\nanimal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually\nremain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand,\nthose who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually\nto Kåñëa consciousness, certainly progress in life.\nThose who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into\nthree sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who\nare enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate\nliberation from material existence, and (3) those who are devotees in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the\nscriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those\nwho are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.\nThose who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a\nhigher standard of life—even to the higher planets—but still, because they are\nnot free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious\npath. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation.\nAny activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from\nthe material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in Kåñëa\nconsciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily\naccepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of\nKåñëa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe\nausterity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the\nultimate realization of Kåñëa consciousness, such practice is also auspicious,\nand no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation"

The emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual\nperfection but failed to achieve success.

If he had not done any great evil action which could overwhelm his Yogic tendencies he will certainly continue his Yogic practices in this birth very vigorously through the force of the Yogic Samskaras created by his Yogic practices in his previous birth. If the force of the evil action is stronger? the Yogic tendencies will be overpowered or suppressed for some time. As soon as the fruits of the evil actions are exhausted? the force of the Yogic Samskaras will begin to manifest itself. He will start his Yogic practices vigorously and attain the final beatitude of life.Even an enirer in whom a desire for information about Yoga is kindled goes beyond the Brahmic word? i.e.? the Vedas. He rises superior to the performer of the Vedic rituals and ceremonies. He is beyond the entanglement of forms and ceremonies. He is not satisfied with mere ritualism. He thirsts for a satisfaction higher than that given by the sensual objects. He who simply wishes to know the nature of the principles of Yoga frees himself from the SabdaBrahma? i.e.? from the effects of the Vedic rituals and ceremonies. If this be the case of a simple enirer? how much more exalted should be the condition of a real practitioner or knower of Yoga or of one who is established in Nirvikalpa Samadhi He will be absolutely free from the effects of the Vedic rituals and ceremonies. He will enjoy the eternal bliss and the everlasting peace of the Eternal.An aspirant who is desirous of obtaining Moksha alone is not affected by the sin of nonperformance of action even if he renounces all the obligatory and optional or occasional duties. He goes beyond the word of Brahman (the scripture or the Vedas).When such is the case of an aspirant who is without any spiritual inclinations or Samskaras of the previous birth? how much more exalted will be the state of that student who has done Yogic practices in his previous birth? who has fallen from Yoga in his previous birth? and who has taken up Yoga in this birth? renouncing all the worldly activitiesImpelled by the strong desire for liberation he practises rigorous Sadhana in this birth. He is constrained? as it were? by the force of the good Samskaras of his previous birth to take to Yogic practices in spite of himself.In this verse the Lord lays stress on the fact that no effort in the practice of Yoga goes in vain.

Although Öhäkura\nHaridäsa happened to take his birth in a Muslim family, he was elevated to the\npost of nämäcärya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of\nchanting three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare Kåñëa,\nHare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma,\nHare Hare. And because he chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is\nunderstood that in his previous life he must have passed through all the\nritualistic methods of the Vedas, known as çabda-brahma. Unless, therefore,\none is purified, one cannot take to the principles of Kåñëa consciousness or\nbecome engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare Kåñëa."

        "PurPort": "The word bhajate is significant here. Bhajate has its root in the verb bhaj,\nwhich is used when there is need of service. The English word “worship”\ncannot be used in the same sense as bhaj. Worship means to adore, or to show\nrespect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is\nespecially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid\nworshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but\none cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly\ncondemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme\nLord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The\nBhägavatam (11.5.3) confirms this as follows:\nya eñäà puruñaà säkñäd\nätma-prabhavam éçvaram\nna bhajanty avajänanti\nsthänäd bhrañöäù patanty adhaù\n“Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the\nprimeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down\nfrom his constitutional position.”\nIn this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable\nto the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word “worship” can be applied to\ndemigods or to any other common living entity. The word avajänanti, used in\nthis verse of Çrémad-Bhägavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-gétä. Avajänanti\nmäà müòhäù: “Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Lord Kåñëa.” Such fools take it upon themselves to write\ncommentaries on the Bhagavad-gétä without an attitude of service to the Lord.\nConsequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and\nthe word “worship.”\nThe culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga. All other\nyogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually\nmeans bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of\nbhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a\nlong way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the\nbeginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and\nrenunciation, the stage is called jïäna-yoga. When jïäna-yoga increases in\nmeditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is\non Him, it is called añöäìga-yoga. And when one surpasses the añöäìga-yoga\nand comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa, it is\ncalled bhakti yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal,\nbut to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas.\nThe yogé who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good\nfortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further\nprogress is called by that particular name: karma-yogé, jïäna-yogé or\ndhyäna-yogé, räja-yogé, haöha-yogé, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the\npoint of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas.\nTherefore, to become Kåñëa conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as,\nwhen we speak of Himälayan, we refer to the world’s highest mountains, of\nwhich the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\nIt is by great fortune that one comes to Kåñëa consciousness on the path of\nbhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal\nyogé concentrates his attention on Kåñëa, who is called Çyämasundara, who is\nas beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun,\nwhose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower-garlanded.\nIlluminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti. He\nincarnates in different forms such as Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha and Kåñëa, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the\nson of mother Yaçodä, and He is known as Kåñëa, Govinda and Väsudeva. He\nis the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all\nopulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these\nfeatures of the Lord, he is called the highest yogi.\nThis stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga,\nas is confirmed in all Vedic literature:\nyasya deve parä bhaktir\nyathä deve tathä gurau\ntasyaite kathitä hy arthäù\nprakäçante mahätmanaù\n“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and\nthe spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically\nrevealed.” [ÇU 6.23(526)]\nBhaktir asya bhajanaà tad ihämutropädhi-nairäsyenämuñmin\nmanaù-kalpanam, etad eva naiñkarmyam. “Bhakti means devotional service to\nthe Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in\nthe next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the\nSupreme. That is the purpose of naiñkarmya.” (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.15)\nThese are some of the means for performance of bhakti, or Kåñëa\nconsciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of Dhyäna-yoga."

        "PurPort": "In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, the nature of Kåñëa\nconsciousness is fully described. Kåñëa is full in all opulences, and how He\nmanifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate\npeople who become attached to Kåñëa and four kinds of unfortunate people\nwho never take to Kåñëa are described in this chapter.\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, the living entity has been\ndescribed as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to\nself-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it\nhas been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa,\nor in other words Kåñëa consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By\nconcentrating one’s mind upon Kåñëa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth\ncompletely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Paramätmä\nrealization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is\npartial. Full and scientific knowledge is Kåñëa, and everything is revealed to\nthe person in Kåñëa consciousness. In complete Kåñëa consciousness one\nknows that Kåñëa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of\nyoga are only steppingstones on the path of Kåñëa consciousness. One who\ntakes directly to Kåñëa consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti\nand Paramätmä in full. By practice of Kåñëa consciousness yoga, one can know\neverything in full—namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the\nmaterial nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.\nOne should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the\nSixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa the Supreme is made\npossible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which\nçravaëam is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna,\ntac chåëu, or “Hear from Me.” No one can be a greater authority than Kåñëa,\nand therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to\nbecome a perfectly Kåñëa conscious person. One has therefore to learn from\nKåñëa directly or from a pure devotee of Kåñëa—and not from a nondevotee\nupstart, puffed up with academic education.\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam this process of understanding Kåñëa, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the\nSecond Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\nçåëvatäà sva-kathäù kåñëaù\npuëya-çravaëa-kértanaù\nhådy antaù-stho hy abhadräëi\nvidhunoti suhåt satäm\nnañöa-präyeñv abhadreñu\nnityaà bhägavata-sevayä\nbhagavaty uttama-çloke\nbhaktir bhavati naiñöhiké\ntadä rajas-tamo-bhäväù\nkäma-lobhädayaç ca ye\nceta etair anäviddhaà\nsthitaà sattve prasédati\nevaà prasanna-manaso\nbhagavad-bhakti-yogataù\nbhagavat-tattva-vijïänaà\nmukta-saìgasya jäyate\nbhidyate hådaya-granthiç\nchidyante sarva-saàçayäù\nkñéyante cäsya karmäëi\ndåñöa evätmanéçvare\n“To hear about Kåñëa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly\nthrough the Bhagavad-gétä, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears\nabout Kåñëa, Lord Kåñëa, who is dwelling in everyone’s heart, acts as a\nbest-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in\nhearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant\ntranscendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kåñëa from the\nBhägavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service\nof the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the\nmodes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are\ndiminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains\nsteady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional\nservice and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs\nthe hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the\nstage of asaàçayaà-samagram, understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth\nPersonality of Godhead.” (Bhäg. 1.2.17–21)\nTherefore only by hearing from Kåñëa or from His devotee in Kåñëa\nconsciousness can one understand the science of Kåñëa."

        "PurPort": "There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands, one may be\nsufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the\nself, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is\nsimply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending\nand mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The\nfirst six chapters of the Gétä are meant for those who are interested in\ntranscendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the\nprocess of realization by jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga and discrimination of the self\nfrom matter. However, Kåñëa can be known only by persons who are in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman\nrealization, for this is easier than understanding Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the Supreme\nPerson, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and\nParamätmä. The yogés and jïänés are confused in their attempts to understand\nKåñëa. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, has\nadmitted in his Gétä commentary that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, his followers do not accept Kåñëa as such, for it is very difficult to\nknow Kåñëa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal\nBrahman.\nKåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the\nprimeval Lord Govinda. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/\nanädir ädir govindaù sarva-käraëa-käraëam. It is very difficult for the\nnondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of\nbhakti, or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of\nbhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they\ntake up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called\npath of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti\nmay be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and\nregulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path.\nÇréla Rüpa Gosvämé writes in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.2.101):\nçruti-småti-puräëädipaïcarätra-vidhià vinä\naikäntiké harer bhaktir\nutpätäyaiva kalpate\n“Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic\nliteratures like the Upaniñads, Puräëas and Närada-païcarätra is simply an\nunnecessary disturbance in society.”\nIt is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the\nParamätmä-realized yogé to understand Kåñëa the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead as the son of mother Yaçodä or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the\ngreat demigods are sometimes confused about Kåñëa (muhyanti yat sürayaù).\nMäà tu veda na kaçcana: “No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord says. And if\none does know Him, then sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù. “Such a great soul is very\nrare.” Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one\ncannot know Kåñëa as He is (tattvataù), even though one is a great scholar or\nphilosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable\ntranscendental qualities in Kåñëa, in the cause of all causes, in His\nomnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty,\nknowledge and renunciation, because Kåñëa is benevolently inclined to His\ndevotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone\ncan realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:\nataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi\nna bhaved grähyam indriyaiù\nsevonmukhe hi jihvädau\nsvayam eva sphuraty adaù\n“No one can understand Kåñëa as He is by the blunt material senses. But He\nreveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their\ntranscendental loving service unto Him.” (Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.234)"

        "PurPort": "The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His\ndiverse energies. Material nature is called prakåti, or the energy of the Lord in\nHis different puruña incarnations (expansions) as described in the\nSätvata-tantra:\nviñëos tu tréëi rüpäëi\npuruñäkhyäny atho viduù\nekaà tu mahataù srañöå\ndvitéyaà tv aëòa-saàsthitam\ntåtéyaà sarva-bhüta-sthaà\ntäni jïätvä vimucyate\n“For material creation, Lord Kåñëa’s plenary expansion assumes three\nViñëus. The first one, Mahä-Viñëu, creates the total material energy, known as\nthe mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, enters into all the\nuniverses to create diversities in each of them. The third, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu,\nis diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as\nParamätmä. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these\nthree Viñëus can be liberated from material entanglement.”\nThis material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of\nthe Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three\nViñëu expansions of Lord Kåñëa. These puruñas are called incarnations.\nGenerally one who does not know the science of God (Kåñëa) assumes that\nthis material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the\nliving entities are the puruñas—the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the\nmaterial energy. According to Bhagavad-gétä this atheistic conclusion is false.\nIn the verse under discussion it is stated that Kåñëa is the original cause of the\nmaterial manifestation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam also confirms this. The ingredients\nof the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the\nbrahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual\nenergy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the\nbrahmajyoti as there are in the Vaikuëöhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts\nthis brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal. The Paramätmä manifestation is\nalso a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. The\nParamätmä manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the\nfactual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa. He is\nthe complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and\ninternal energies.\nIn the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above\nmentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water,\nfire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations,\nwithin which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations\nof physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises\nthese ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind,\nintelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who\ndeal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do\nnot know the ultimate source, Kåñëa. The false ego—“I am,” and “It is mine,\nwhich constitute the basic principle of material existence—includes ten sense\norgans for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation,\ncalled the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the\nLord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are\nthe subject matter of Säìkhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally\noffshoots from Kåñëa’s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic\nSäìkhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know Kåñëa as\nthe cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the Säìkhya\nphilosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of Kåñëa, as it is\ndescribed in the Bhagavad-gétä"

It is the very lifeelement or the principle of Selfconsciousness? by which this universe is sustained.",
        "PurPort": "Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior\nnature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter\nmanifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind,\nintelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth,\netc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living\nentities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are\nthe superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the\nentire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act\nunless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always\ncontrolled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always\ncontrolled by the Lord—they have no independent existence. They are never\nequally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the\nliving entities and the Lord is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.87.30) as\nfollows:\naparimitä dhruväs tanu-bhåto yadi sarva-gatäs\ntarhi na çäsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathä\najani ca yan-mayaà tad avimucya niyantå bhavet\nsamam anujänatäà yad amataà mata-duñöatayä\n“O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and\nall-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the\nliving entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are\nat once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails\nsurrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make\nthem happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.\nTherefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that\nGod and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a\nfaulty and polluted opinion.”\nThe Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is the only controller, and all living entities are\ncontrolled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the\nquality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are\nnever equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and\nsubtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets\nhis real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the\ninfluence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes\nfree from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage\ncalled mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material\nillusion, thinks, “I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.” His actual\nposition is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the\nconception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may\nconclude that the Gétä confirms the living entity to be only one of the\nmulti-energies of Kåñëa; and when this energy is freed from material\ncontamination, it becomes fully Kåñëa conscious, or liberated."

He is also the efficient or the instrumental cause (NimittaKarana). (Cf.XIV.3)",
        "PurPort": "Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic\nfield of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a\ncertain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is\nmanifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is\ndeveloped because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to\nboyhood and then to manhood because that superior energy, spirit soul, is\npresent. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is\ndeveloped because of the presence of the Supersoul, Viñëu. Therefore spirit\nand matter, which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form, are\noriginally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original\ncause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely the\nliving entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big\ncity, but he cannot be the cause of a big universe. The cause of the big universe\nis the big soul, or the Supersoul. And Kåñëa, the Supreme, is the cause of both\nthe big and small souls. Therefore He is the original cause of all causes.

        "PurPort": "There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth\nis personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, the Absolute\nTruth is the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, and this is confirmed in every\nstep. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a\nperson. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also\nthe affirmation of the Brahma-saàhitä: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù\nsac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of\nGodhead is Lord Kåñëa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure,\nGovinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These\nauthorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the\ncause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the\nVedic version given in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.10): tato yad uttarataraà\ntad arüpam anämayam/ ya etad vidur amåtäs te bhavanti athetare duùkham\neväpiyanti. “In the material world Brahmä, the primeval living entity within\nthe universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human\nbeings and lower animals. But beyond Brahmä there is the Transcendence,\nwho has no material form and is free from all material contaminations.\nAnyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do\nnot know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.”\nThe impersonalist puts more stress on the word arüpam. But this arüpam is\nnot impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and\nknowledge as described in the Brahma-saàhitä quoted above. Other verses in\nthe Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.8–9) substantiate this as follows:\nvedäham etaà puruñaà mahäntam\näditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät\ntam eva viditväti måtyum eti\nnänyaù panthä vidyate ’yanäya\nyasmät paraà näparam asti kiïcid\nyasmän näëéyo no jyäyo ’sti kiïcit\nvåkña iva stabdho divi tiñöhaty ekas\ntenedaà pürëaà puruñeëa sarvam\n“I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all\nmaterial conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the\nbonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this\nknowledge of that Supreme Person.\n“There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person, because He is the\nsupermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest.\nHe is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as\na tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies.”\nFrom these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-pervading by His multi-energies,\nboth material and spiritual.\nT"

        "PurPort": "This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material\nand spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by\nHis different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the\ndemigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the\nsunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His\nall-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of\nwater. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed\nwith salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure\ntaste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the\npresence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the\nLord for His kindly supplying tasty water to quench man’s thirst. That is the\nway of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict\nbetween personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the\nimpersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in\neverything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya\nestablished His sublime doctrine: acintya\nbheda-and-abheda-tattva—simultaneous oneness and difference.\nThe light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the\nbrahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And praëava, or\nthe oàkära transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn,\naddresses the Supreme Lord. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid\nof addressing the Supreme Lord Kåñëa by His innumerable names, they prefer\nto vibrate the transcendental sound oàkära. But they do not realize that\noàkära is the sound representation of Kåñëa. The jurisdiction of Kåñëa\nconsciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows Kåñëa consciousness is\nblessed. Those who do not know Kåñëa are in illusion, and so knowledge of\nKåñëa is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage."

Vibhävasu means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we\ncannot cook, etc., and that fire is Kåñëa. The heat in the fire is Kåñëa.\nAccording to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the\nbelly. So even for digestion fire is needed. In Kåñëa consciousness we become\naware that earth, water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and\nall material elements are due to Kåñëa. The duration of man’s life is also due to\nKåñëa. Therefore by the grace of Kåñëa, man can prolong his life or diminish\nit. So Kåñëa consciousness is active in every sphere."

When the veil is removed by the dawn of knowledge of the Self the Jiva loses his characteras a Jiva or an individual soul and becomes identical with Brahman. (Cf.XV.3and4)",
        "PurPort": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all\nthese energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies\nand are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy their original\nsuperior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot\npossibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and\nspiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nare eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the\nLord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is\nalso eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally\nconditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a\ncertain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of\nmaterial nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an\ninferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the\nsupreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material\nnature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and\nmovement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature,\nalthough inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of\nthe cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows: mäyäà tu\nprakåtià vidyän mäyinaà tu maheçvaram. “Although mäyä [illusion] is false or\ntemporary, the background of mäyä is the supreme magician, the Personality of\nGodhead, who is Maheçvara, the supreme controller.” (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad\n4.10)\nAnother meaning of guëa is rope; it is to be understood that the\nconditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the\nhands and feet cannot free himself—he must be helped by a person who is\nunbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be\nliberated. Therefore, only Lord Kåñëa, or His bona fide representative the\nspiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help,\none cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service,\nor Kåñëa consciousness, can help one gain such release. Kåñëa, being the Lord\nof illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the\nconditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the\nsurrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is\noriginally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of\nthe Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent\nmaterial nature.\nThe words mäm eva are also significant. Mäm means unto Kåñëa (Viñëu)\nonly, and not Brahmä or Çiva. Although Brahmä and Çiva are greatly elevated\nand are almost on the level of Viñëu, it is not possible for such incarnations of\nrajo-guëa (passion) and tamo-guëa (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul\nfrom the clutches of mäyä. In other words, both Brahmä and Çiva are also\nunder the influence of mäyä. Only Viñëu is the master of mäyä; therefore He\nalone can give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas (Çvetäçvatara\nUpaniñad 3.8) confirm this in the phrase tam eva viditvä. or “Freedom is\npossible only by understanding Kåñëa.” Even Lord Çiva affirms that liberation\ncan be achieved only by the mercy of Viñëu. Lord Çiva says, mukti-pradätä\nsarveñäà viñëur eva na saàçayaù: “There is no doubt that Viñëu is the deliverer\nof liberation for everyone.”\n"

        "PurPort": "It is said in Bhagavad-gétä that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus\nfeet of the Supreme Personality Kåñëa one can surmount the stringent laws of\nmaterial nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated\nphilosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of\nordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa, the all-powerful\nPersonality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature,\nis sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and\nperseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible\nby simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, then why don’t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this\nsimple method?\nThe Gétä answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of\nsociety like Brahmä, Çiva, Kapila, the Kumäras, Manu, Vyäsa, Devala, Asita,\nJanaka, Prahläda, Bali, and later on Madhväcärya, Rämänujäcärya, Çré\nCaitanya and many others—who are faithful philosophers, politicians,\neducators, scientists, etc.—surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person,\nthe all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists,\neducators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material\ngain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea\nof God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently\ncomplicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve\nthem. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the\nunauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of “planning\ncommissions.”\nThe atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word duñkåtinaù, or\n“miscreants.” Kåté means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist\nplanmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any\ngigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the\natheist’s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord,\nthe atheistic planmaker is called duñkåté. which indicates that his intelligence\nand efforts are misdirected.\nIn the Gétä it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under\nthe direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works\nas the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But\nstill material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless\ntemperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the\nSupreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his\nplans are baffled, as in the case of Hiraëyakaçipu and Rävaëa, whose plans\nwere smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists,\nphilosophers, administrators and educators. These duñkåtinas, or miscreants,\nare of four different patterns, as outlined below.\n(1) The müòhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of\nburden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do\nnot want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast\nof burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his\nmaster. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night.\nHe remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a\nwhile under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite\nat the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings\npoetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others.\nThis is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom\nhe should work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yajïa\n(sacrifice).\nMost often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of\nself-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the\nliving being. To such müòhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life’s\nall in all—despite the fact that the müòhas enjoy only a very small fraction of\nthe fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive\ngain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with\npractically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for\nthe benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish\nworkers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never\nsurrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of\nHim from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to\naccept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will\nuntiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering\nmundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living\nforce that moves the material world.\n(2) Another class of duñkåté, or miscreant, is called the narädhama, or the\nlowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest.\nOut of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000\nhuman species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life\nthat are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have\nregulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are\nsocially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be\nconsidered narädhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the\npurpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and\nman’s relation with Him. In the Gétä the Personality of Godhead clearly states\nthat there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The\ncivilized form of human life is meant for man’s reviving the lost consciousness of\nhis eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Çré\nKåñëa, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a\nnarädhama. We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is\nin the mother’s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God\nfor deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To\npray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being\nbecause he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child\nforgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced\nby mäyä, the illusory energy.\nIt is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness\ndormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in\nthe Manu-småti. which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for\nreviving God consciousness in the system of varëäçrama. However, no process\nis strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of\nthe population is narädhama.\nWhen the whole population becomes narädhama. naturally all their\nso-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of\nphysical nature. According to the standard of the Gétä, a learned man is he\nwho sees on equal terms the learned brähmaëa. the dog. the cow, the elephant\nand the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. Çré Nityänanda Prabhu,\nwho is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical\nnarädhamas. the brothers Jagäi and Mädhäi, and showed how the mercy of a\nreal devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the narädhama who is\ncondemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual\nconsciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.\nÇré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in propagating the bhägavata-dharma, or\nactivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the\nmessage of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is\nBhagavad-gétä. The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this\nsubmissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an\naural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will\nof the Supreme Lord? Narädhamas, or the lowest of mankind, will fully neglect\nthe prime duty of the human being.\n(3) The next class of duñkåté is called mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù, or those persons\nwhose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory\nmaterial energy. They are mostly very learned fellows—great philosophers,\npoets, literati, scientists, etc.—but the illusory energy misguides them, and\ntherefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.\nThere are a great number of mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù at the present moment,\neven amongst the scholars of the Bhagavad-gétä. In the Gétä, in plain and\nsimple language, it is stated that Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the\nfather of Brahmä, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Çré Kåñëa is\nsaid to be not only the father of Brahmä but also the father of all species of life.\nHe is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Paramätmä; the Supersoul in\nevery entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and\neveryone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear\nstatements, the mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù deride the personality of the Supreme\nLord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that\nthe blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental\nfeature of the Supreme Lord.\nAll the unauthorized interpretations of the Gétä by the class of\nmäyayäpahåta-jïänäù, outside the purview of the paramparä system, are so\nmany stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded\ninterpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa, nor do they\nteach others to follow this principle.\n(4) The last class of duñkåté is called äsuraà bhävam äçritäù, or those of\ndemonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the\nSupreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable\nto give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him\nsubordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the\nGétä. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present\na number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such\npersons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead,\ncannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa.\nÇré Yämunäcärya Albandaru of South India said, “O my Lord! You are\nunknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Your\nuncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality’s being\nconfirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite\nYour being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth\nof knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly\nqualities.”\nTherefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the\ndeluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never\nsurrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all\nscriptural and authoritative advice."

        "PurPort": "Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of\nthe scriptures, and they are called sukåtinaù, or those who obey the rules and\nregulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less,\ndevoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of\nmen—those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money,\nthose who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching\nafter knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme\nLord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure\ndevotees, because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for\ndevotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without\ndesire for material profit. The Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines pure\ndevotion thus:\nanyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà\njïäna-karmädy-anävåtam\nänukülyena kåñëänuçélanaà bhaktir uttamä\n [Madhya 19.167]\n“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\nKåñëa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive\nactivities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”\nWhen these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional\nservice and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they\nalso become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them\ndevotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and\nwithout spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in\ncontact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.\nThose who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in\nmaterial distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in\ntheir distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come\nsometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know\nabout God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of\nknowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the\nSupreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of\nthe impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramätmä and come to the\npersonal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure\ndevotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of\nknowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material\ndesires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has\nnothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long\nas such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to\nthe Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane\nknowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the\nstage of pure devotional service."

At\nsuch a time one can understand that Lord Çré Kåñëa’s mercy is everything, that\nHe is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not\nindependent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted\nreflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a\nrelationship with the Supreme Lord Kåñëa.

Such surrendered great souls are very rare.\nThis verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and 15)\nof the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad:\nsahasra-çérñä puruñaù\nsahasräkñaù sahasra-pät\nsa bhümià viçvato våtvätyätiñöhad daçäìgulam\npuruña evedaà sarvaà\nyad bhütaà yac ca bhavyam\nutämåtatvasyeçäno\nyad annenätirohati\nIn the Chändogya Upaniñad (5.1.15) it is said, na vai väco na cakñüàñi na\nçroträëi na manäàséty äcakñate präëa iti eväcakñate präëo hy evaitäni sarväëi\nbhavanti: “In the body of a living being neither the power to speak, nor the\npower to see, nor the power to hear, nor the power to think is the prime factor;\nit is life which is the center of all activities.” Similarly Lord Väsudeva, or the\nPersonality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, is the prime entity in everything. In\nthis body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental\nactivities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the Supreme Lord.\nAnd because Väsudeva is all-pervading and everything is Väsudeva, the\ndevotee surrenders in full knowledge (cf.

Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied.\nThe worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know\nhow to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not\nmisguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for\nworshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is\nrecommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord\nthink that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord.\nBut a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the master of all. In\nthe Caitanya-caritämåta (Ädi 5.142) it is said, ekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba\nbhåtya: only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is master, and all\nothers are servants.

        "PurPort": "God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to\nhave material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from\nthe material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone’s heart,\nunderstands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all\nliving entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all\nfacilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the\nall-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material\nworld and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is\nthat if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there\nis no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full\nindependence—whatever one likes—but His ultimate instruction we find in\nthe Bhagavad-gétä: one should give up all other engagements and fully\nsurrender unto Him. That will make man happy.\nBoth the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship\nthe demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction\nwithout the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the\nwill of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are\ndistressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the\nVedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such\nand such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to\nworship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of\nlearning, Sarasvaté; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the\ngoddess Umä, the wife of Lord Çiva. In this way there are recommendations in\nthe çästras (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different\ndemigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular\nmaterial facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that\nbenediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the\nbenediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living\nentity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme\nLord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but\nbecause He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts\nof all living entities, Kåñëa gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods.\nThe demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme\nLord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature it is stated:\n“The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the\nheart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the\ndesire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are\ndependent on the supreme will. They are not independent.”\n"

        "PurPort": "The demigods cannot award benedictions to their devotees without the\npermission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything\nis the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the\nworship of demigods and achievement of desired results are due not to the\ndemigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The\nless intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes\nto the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of\nsomething, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit,\nhowever, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods\nusually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something\nundue is desired by the living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the\ndesire. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that one who worships the Supreme\nLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his\ndesires. Devotional service to the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod\ncannot be on the same platform, because worship of a demigod is material and\ndevotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.\nFor the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are\nimpediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material\nbenefits desired by less intelligent living entities, who therefore prefer to\nworship demigods of the material world rather than engage in the devotional\nservice of the Supreme Lord.\nT"

        "PurPort": "Some commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä say that one who worships a\ndemigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the\nworshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various\ndemigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a\nworshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone\nwants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god’s\nplanet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped,\nwill reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is\nclearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the\nmaterial world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the\nsupreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.\nHere the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the\nbody of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by\nworshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent\nbecause they don’t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some\nof them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways\nto supply food. This isn’t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body\nthrough the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different\nparts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they\nbelieve that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the\nSupreme Lord.\nNot only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living\nentities are also. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that the brähmaëas are\nthe head of the Supreme Lord, the kñatriyas are His arms, the vaiçyas are His\nwaist, the çüdras are His legs, and all serve different functions. Regardless of\nthe situation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and\nparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not\nunderstand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside. This\nis not the same destination the devotee reaches.\nThe results achieved by the demigods’ benedictions are perishable because\nwithin this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are\nall perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results\nachieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is\nperformed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee\nengaged in Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord\nachieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements\nand those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The\nSupreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited.\nTherefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited."

        "PurPort": "Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less\nintelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord\nKåñëa in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to\nignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form.\nYämunäcärya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession of\nRämänujäcärya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection.\nHe says,\ntväà çéla-rüpa-caritaiù parama-prakåñöaiù\nsattvena sättvikatayä prabalaiç ca çästraiù\nprakhyäta-daiva-paramärtha-vidäà mataiç ca\nnaiväsura-prakåtayaù prabhavanti boddhum\n“My dear Lord, devotees like Vyäsadeva and Närada know You to be the\nPersonality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can\ncome to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can\nthus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those\nwho are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees,\ncannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert\nsuch nondevotees may be in discussing Vedänta and the Upaniñads and other\nVedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of\nGodhead.” (Stotra-ratna 12)\nIn the Brahma-saàhitä it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot\nbe understood simply by study of the Vedänta literature. Only by the mercy of\nthe Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in\nthis verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods\nless intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Vedänta and\nspeculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true Kåñëa consciousness\nare also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God’s\npersonal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute\nTruth is impersonal are described as abuddhayaù, which means those who do\nnot know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the\nimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul—but the\nultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern\nimpersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great\npredecessor Çaìkaräcärya, who has specifically stated that Kåñëa is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the\nSupreme Truth, think Kåñëa to be only the son of Devaké and Vasudeva, or a\nprince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in the\nBhagavad-gétä (9.11). Avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam: “Only\nthe fools regard Me as an ordinary person.”\nThe fact is that no one can understand Kåñëa without rendering devotional\nservice and without developing Kåñëa consciousness. The Bhägavatam\n(10.14.29) confirms this:\nathäpi te deva padämbuja-dvayaprasäda-leçänugåhéta eva hi\njänäti tattvaà bhagavan-mahimno\nna cänya eko ’pi ciraà vicinvan\n“My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus\nfeet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who\nspeculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to\nknow You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.” One\ncannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or His form,\nquality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature.\nOne must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in\nKåñëa consciousness, beginning by chanting the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa,\nHare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma,\nHare Hare—then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that Kåñëa has a body made of this\nmaterial nature and that all His activities, His form and everything are mäyä.\nThese impersonalists are known as Mäyävädés. They do not know the ultimate\ntruth.\nThe twentieth verse clearly states, kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù prapadyante\n’nya-devatäù. “Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the\ndifferent demigods.” It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, there are demigods who have their different planets, and the Lord\nalso has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse, devän deva-yajo yänti\nmad-bhaktä yänti mäm api: the worshipers of the demigods go to the different\nplanets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord Kåñëa go to the\nKåñëaloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists\nstill maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions.\nFrom the study of the Gétä does it appear that the demigods and their abodes\nare impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor Kåñëa, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord Kåñëa is\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the\ndemigods have theirs.\nTherefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that\nform is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not\nimposed. From the Bhagavad-gétä we can clearly understand that the forms of\nthe demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing\nand that Lord Kåñëa is sac-cid-änanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas\nalso confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät, or by\nnature full of blissful pleasure, and that He is the reservoir of unlimited\nauspicious qualities. And in the Gétä the Lord says that although He is aja\n(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from\nthe Bhagavad-gétä. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist\nis false as far as the statements of the Gétä are concerned. It is clear herein that\nthe Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord Kåñëa, has both form and personality."

        "PurPort": "It may be argued that since Kåñëa was present on this earth and was visible\nto everyone, then why isn’t He manifest to everyone now? But actually He was\nnot manifest to everyone. When Kåñëa was present there were only a few\npeople who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nIn the assembly of Kurus, when Çiçupäla spoke against Kåñëa’s being elected\npresident of the assembly, Bhéñma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be\nthe Supreme God. Similarly, the Päëòavas and a few others knew that He was\nthe Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and\nthe common man. Therefore in the Bhagavad-gétä Kåñëa says that but for His\npure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest\nonly to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to\nunintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His internal potency.\nIn the prayers of Kunté in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.8.19) it is said that the\nLord is covered by the curtain of yoga-mäyä and thus ordinary people cannot\nunderstand Him. This yoga-mäyä curtain is also confirmed in the Éçopaniñad\n(mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\nhiraëmayena pätreëa\nsatyasyäpihitaà mukham\ntat tvaà püñann apävåëu\nsatya-dharmäya dåñöaye\n“O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional\nservice to You is the highest religious principle. Therefore, I pray that You will\nalso maintain me. Your transcendental form is covered by the yoga-mäyä. The\nbrahmajyoti is the covering of the internal potency. May You kindly remove\nthis glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-änanda-vigraha\n[Bs. 5.1], Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.” The Supreme Personality\nof Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by\nthe internal potency of the brahmajyoti, and the less intelligent impersonalists\ncannot see the Supreme on this account.\nAlso in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahmä: “O\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who\ncan calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always\nexpanding Your internal potency, and therefore no one can understand You.\nLearned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution\nof the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate\nYour energy and potency, although You are present before them.” The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa, is not only unborn but also\navyaya, inexhaustible.

        "PurPort": "Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If\nKåñëa, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were mäyä, material,\nas the impersonalists consider Him to be, then like the living entity He would\nchange His body and forget everything about His past life. Anyone with a\nmaterial body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life,\nnor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know\nwhat is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from\nmaterial contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\nUnlike the ordinary human being, Lord Kåñëa clearly says that He\ncompletely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the\npresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have\nseen that Lord Kåñëa remembers instructing Vivasvän, the sun-god, millions of\nyears ago. Kåñëa knows every living entity because He is situated in every\nliving being’s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living\nentity as Supersoul and His presence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nthe less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot\nrealize Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of\nÇré Kåñëa is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and mäyä is like a cloud. In\nthe material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds\nand different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky\ntemporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun,\nmoon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly, mäyä cannot cover the\nSupreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less\nintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of\nmillions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form\nof life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one\ncan understand what Lord Kåñëa is. Even if one is perfected by realization of\nimpersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä, he cannot possibly understand\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, without being in Kåñëa\nconsciousness."

This elevation is possible in Kåñëa consciousness in the association of\npure devotees, for in the association of great devotees one can be delivered\nfrom delusion.\nIt is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.5.2) that if one actually wants to be\nliberated he must render service to the devotees (mahat-seväà dväram ähur\nvimukteù); but one who associates with materialistic people is on the path\nleading to the darkest region of existence (tamo-dväraà yoñitäà saìgi-saìgam).\nAll the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned\nsouls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their\nconstitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest\nviolation of God’s law.

By gradual development of Kåñëa consciousness in good association,\nthe living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of Kåñëa he has\nbecome conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand\nthat this human form of life is an opportunity to regain Kåñëa consciousness\nand that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme\nLord.\nMany subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the\ninquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of\nBrahman, knowledge of Paramätmä, liberation from birth, death and diseases,\nand worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in\nKåñëa consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply\ndirectly engages himself in activities of Kåñëa consciousness and thereby\nfactually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord\nKåñëa. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the\nSupreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by his doing so,\nall his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called dåòha-vrata,\nand it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga, or transcendental loving service. That is\nthe verdict of all scriptures.

Viñëu is the chief of\nthe primal demigods, including Brahmä and Çiva, and Indra is the chief of the\nadministrative demigods. Both Indra and Viñëu are worshiped by yajïa\nperformances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yajïa\n(sacrifice) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity.\nArjuna addresses the Lord as Madhusüdana because Kåñëa once killed a\ndemon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of\ndoubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a\nKåñëa conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since Kåñëa\nis so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhusüdana so\nthat Kåñëa might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna’s mind.\nNow the word prayäëa-käle in this verse is very significant because\nwhatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very\nanxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness.\nWhat should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all\nthe bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition.\nThus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the\nSupreme Lord. Mahäräja Kulaçekhara, a great devotee, prays, “My dear Lord,\njust now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the\nswan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet.” The\nmetaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in\ndigging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower.\nMahäräja Kulaçekhara says to the Lord, “Now my mind is undisturbed, and I\nam quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am\nsure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But\nif I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen,\nbecause at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be\nchoked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name.\nBetter let me die immediately.” Arjuna questions how a person can fix his\nmind on Kåñëa’s lotus feet at such a time.\n"

The living beings (Bhutas) live and develop on account of rice and other foodstuffs. Therefore Yajnas are the cause of the genesis and support of all beings.",
        "PurPort": "Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not\nchanged at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman\nrefers to the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from\nthe position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his\nnature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual consciousness, Kåñëa\nconsciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is\nin material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material\nworld. That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of material\nconsciousness.\nIn Vedic literature the living entity is called jévätmä and Brahman, but he is\nnever called Parabrahman. The living entity (jévätmä) takes different\npositions—sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies\nhimself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior,\nspiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord’s marginal energy.\nAccording to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a\nmaterial or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of\nthe 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In\nmaterial nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast,\nbird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets and\nenjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yajïa), but when his\nmerit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process\nis called karma.\nThe Chändogya Upaniñad describes the Vedic sacrificial process. On the\nsacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings are made into five kinds of fire. The five\nkinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man\nand woman, and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on\nthe moon, rain, grains and semen.\nIn the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to\nattain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the\nmerit of sacrifice is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form\nof rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and\ntransformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living\nentity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat\nthe same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the\nmaterial path. The Kåñëa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He\ntakes directly to Kåñëa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to\nGodhead.\nImpersonalist commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä unreasonably assume\nthat Brahman takes the form of jéva in the material world, and to substantiate\nthis they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the Gétä. But in this verse the\nLord also speaks of the living entity as “an eternal fragment of Myself.” The\nfragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but\nthe Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that\nthe Supreme Brahman assumes the form of jéva is not acceptable. It is\nimportant to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is\ndistinguished from Parabrahman (the Supreme Lord)."

The Supersoul,\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the\nwitness of the individual soul’s activities and is the source of the soul’s various\ntypes of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity\nto act freely and witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different\nmanifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the\npure Kåñëa conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service to the Lord.\nThe gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivata is contemplated by\nthe neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as\nSupersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form, or\nviräö-puruña, whose legs are considered the lower planets, whose eyes are\nconsidered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper\nplanetary system."

The word smaran (“remembering”) is important.\nRemembrance of Kåñëa is not possible for the impure soul who has not\npracticed Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service. Therefore one should\npractice Kåñëa consciousness from the very beginning of life. If one wants to\nachieve success at the end of his life, the process of remembering Kåñëa is\nessential. Therefore one should constantly, incessantly chant the\nmahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Lord Caitanya has advised that one be as\ntolerant as a tree (taror iva sahiñëunä). There may be so many impediments for\na person who is chanting Hare Kåñëa. Nonetheless, tolerating all these\nimpediments, one should continue to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa\nKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, so that at\nthe end of one’s life one can have the full benefit of Kåñëa consciousness."

The most prominent thought of ones life occupies the mind at the time of death. The predominant idea at the time of death is what in normal life has occupied his attention most. The last thought determines the nature or character of the body to be attained next. As a man thinketh? so shall he becometh.The force of Samskaras which one has created by his previous practice is the cause of their remembrance at death. Those who have practised worship of God throughout their life can have remembrance of their tutelary deity at the time of death.The analogy of the wasp and the caterpillar (BhramaraKitaNyaya) can be applied here. The caterpillar constantly remembers the wasp and becomes eventually transformed into a wasp. Even so he who constantly remembers his tutelary deity becomes identical with that deity. Nandikesvara is an example. He constantly thought of his Lord and assumed a form eal to that of the Lord.If you constantly think of the immortal Self during your lifetime? you will entertain the thought of the Self only even at the time of death and will attain immortality. If you always think of your body and identify yourself with the perishable body you will be born again and again. If you think of you pet dog at the time of death you will be born as a dog. Raja Jadabharata thought of his pet deer at the time of his death and so he took the birth of a deer.Every man has a definite outlook on life? definite mode of thinking? definite cravings? desires and hopes? definite character? temperament? taste? disposition and attitude.This is all due to the impressions which have become part and parcel of his subconsciousness. This is all due to experiences which have left their indelible impressions on his mind.He always thinks of his body and physical needs. He searches for his happiness in the external? perishable objects. He identifies himself with the perishable body. He ignores his innermost? allblissful? immortal Self? the source of everything. He trains his body? senses? mind and intellect in worldly pursuits. He ignores the Yogic discipline of the mind and the senses. Therefore he always thinks of his body? bread? drink and clothing. He forgets all about God and the Self? the indweller? an embodiment of bliss and knowledge? fountain of joy and happiness.Desires are endless. Therefore man cannot gratify them in one birth. At the time of death the whole storehouse of impressions and desires is churned out and the most prominent? the strongest and cherished desire comes to the surface of the mind or the field of mental consciousness. This churned up butter or cream (cherished desire) arrests his attention for immediate gratification. He thinks of only that at the time of death. Just as the most vital mango plant shoots up prominently in the nursery? so also the strongest desire shoots up on the surface of the mind. If the desire is not gratified his mind gets saturated with it and it is gratified in his nextbirth. This desire will become very promenent in his next birth.You yourself are the author of your own destiny. You yourself are responsible for your thoughts? character? feelings? actions and experiences. You planted certain worldly desires and Samskaras in your subconscious mind? and allowed them to germinate and grow. If you had planted spiritual aspiration? the desire for liberation and spiritual Samskaras? you would reap the fruit of immortality and eternal bliss. As you sow so shall you reap.He who practises constant and profound meditation on the Self of his own tutelary deity throughout his life will be able to meet death with an unruffled mind. He alone would go to the Supreme? thinking of It at the time of his departure from this world? too. You should have exclusive devotion to God. Your whole mind must be absorbed in Him. You should not allow any outside worldly impressions? wherein there is an iota of selfish desire? to sink into your subconscious mind. Then you can think of the Lord exclusively at the time of death and enter His very Being.",
        "PurPort": "The process of changing one’s nature at the critical moment of death is\nhere explained. A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of\nKåñëa attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true\nthat a person who thinks of something other than Kåñëa attains the same\ntranscendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can\none die in the proper state of mind? Mahäräja Bharata, although a great\npersonality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he\nwas transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his\npast activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one’s thoughts\nduring the course of one’s life accumulate to influence one’s thoughts at the\nmoment of death, so this life creates one’s next life. If in one’s present life one\nlives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of Kåñëa, it is possible for one\nto remember Kåñëa at the end of one’s life. That will help one be transferred to\nthe transcendental nature of Kåñëa. If one is transcendentally absorbed in\nKåñëa’s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not\nmaterial. Therefore the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,\nHare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare is the best process\nfor successfully changing one’s state of being at the end of one’s life."

Here it is clearly stated that\nthe supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different\nmanifestations and plenary expansions as Näräyaëa, Väsudeva, etc.\nThe devotee can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme\nLord, in any of His features—Näräyaëa, Kåñëa, Räma, etc.—by chanting Hare\nKåñëa. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his\nconstant chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice\nis meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare Kåñëa one\nfixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord.

One example\noften given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so\nis transformed into a butterfly in the same life.

        "PurPort": "The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The\nforemost point is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on\nsomething impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of\nKåñëa, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord\nis puruña, a person—we think of the person Räma and the person Kåñëa. And\nwhether one thinks of Räma or of Kåñëa, what He is like is described in this\nverse of Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord is kavi; that is, He knows past, present and\nfuture and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He\nis the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the\nsupreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of\nhumanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one\nten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small\nthat He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller\nthan the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the\nheart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He\nis still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary\nsystems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in\nthe air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is\nsustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya\n(“inconceivable”) is very significant in this connection. God’s energy is\nbeyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore\ncalled inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this\nmaterial world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material\nworld, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world—so how can we\ncomprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material\nworld, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot\ntouch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding\nuseless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures\nlike the Vedas, Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam and follow the\nprinciples they set down. This will lead one to understanding"

Kåñëa here explains the impersonal Brahman, in which the\nrenounced order of sages enter.\nIn the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are\ntaught to vibrate oà and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living\nwith the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of\nBrahman’s features. This practice is very essential for the student’s\nadvancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmacäré (unmarried\ncelibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has\nchanged so much that there is no possibility of one’s practicing celibacy from\nthe beginning of student life.

(Cf.IX.22?34)",
        "PurPort": "This verse especially describes the final destination attained by the\nunalloyed devotees who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in\nbhakti-yoga. Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of\ndevotees—the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and\nthe speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been\ndescribed: karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and haöha-yoga. The principles of these yoga\nsystems have some bhakti added, but this verse particularly mentions pure\nbhakti-yoga, without any mixture of jïäna, karma or haöha. As indicated by the\nword ananya-cetäù, in pure bhakti-yoga the devotee desires nothing but Kåñëa.\nA pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he\nseek oneness with the brahmajyoti or salvation or liberation from material\nentanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the\nCaitanya-caritämåta the pure devotee is called niñkäma, which means he has\nno desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who\nstrive for personal gain. Whereas a jïäna-yogé, karma-yogé or haöha-yogé has his\nown selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who\nis unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.\nA pure devotee always engages in devotional service to Kåñëa in one of His\nvarious personal features. Kåñëa has various plenary expansions and\nincarnations, such as Räma and Nåsiàha, and a devotee can choose to fix his\nmind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme\nLord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the\npractitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to\nperform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare Kåñëa. The Lord is merciful\nto all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those\nwho always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in\nvarious ways. As stated in the Vedas (Kaöha Upaniñad 1.2.23), yam evaiña våëute\ntena labhyas/ tasyaiña ätmä vivåëute tanuà sväm: one who is fully surrendered\nand engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand\nthe Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in Bhagavad-gétä (10.10), dadämi\nbuddhi-yogaà tam: the Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that\nultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.\nThe special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of\nKåñëa without deviation and without considering the time or place. There\nshould be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere\nand at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like\nVåndävana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can\nlive anywhere and create the atmosphere of Våndävana by his devotional\nservice. It was Çré Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, “Wherever You are, O\nLord—there is Våndävana.”\nAs indicated by the words satatam and nityaçaù, which mean “always,”\n“regularly,” or “every day,” a pure devotee constantly remembers Kåñëa and\nmeditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom\nthe Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the Gétä\nrecommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yogés are engaged in five\ndifferent ways: (1) çänta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality;\n(2) däsya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) säkhya-bhakta,\nengaged as friend; (4) vätsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and (5)\nmädhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of\nthese ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the\ntranscendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the\nSupreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee\ncannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord\ncannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the\nKåñëa conscious process of chanting the mahä-mantra—Hare Kåñëa, Hare\nKåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare\nHare."

The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as avyakta and\nakñara and paramä gati; in other words, that planet is beyond our material\nvision, and it is inexplicable, but it is the highest goal, the destination for the\nmahätmäs (great souls). The mahätmäs receive transcendental messages from\nthe realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in Kåñëa\nconsciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no\nlonger desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to\nbe transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s\nassociation, and nothing else. That is the highest perfection of life. This verse\nspecifically mentions the personalist devotees of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa.\nThese devotees in Kåñëa consciousness achieve the highest perfection of life.\nIn other words, they are the supreme souls."

Just as the tree remains in a latent state in the seed? so also this whole universe remains in a latent state in a seedform in the Mulaprakriti during Pralaya. This is the night of Brahma. This is the cosmic night. Again the world is projected at the beginning of the Mahakalpa (evolution). There comes the cosmic dawn or cosmic day. This eternal rhythm of cosmic day and night (evolution and involution) is kept up in the macrocosm.Nothing that comes under this everrevolving wheel of cosmic day and night lasts for ever. That is the reason why the seers of the Upanishads? the sages of yore? lived in the transcendental Supreme being? the imperishable Self? the indestructible Purusha? the supreme goal of life? the highest end of man? which is beyond the cosmic day and night. Just as the seeds that are fried can hardly germinate? so also those who have attained to the imperishable Brahman? the Absolute? the Eternal? cannot return to this world of sorrow? pain and misery. They know neither day nor night. They are one with Existence Absolute.The manifested and the unmanifested dwell in Brahman. Brahman is beyond the manifested and the unmanifested. When the world and the body are destroyed Brahman is not destroyed. The waves come out and subside? but the ocean remains unaffected. So also the worlds come and subside? but Brahman the source of everything? the source of Mulaprakriti? ever remains unaffected. Just as ornaments come out of gold and then go back to gold when they are melted? so also all the worlds come out of Brahman and go back to Brahman. Gold is in no way affected by the various forms such as earning? bracelets? anklets? etc.? that have been made of it. Even so Brahman is not in the least affected by the projection and destruction (dissolution) of the worlds and the bodies of beings. It remains always as It is.",
        "PurPort": "The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of\nkalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahmä, and one day of Brahmä consists of a\nthousand cycles of four yugas, or ages: Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali. The\ncycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being\npractically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the\nTretä-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the\nDväpara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice\nincreasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the\nyuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an\nabundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically\nnonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to\nsuch a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself\nappears as the Kalki avatära, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and\ncommences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These\nfour yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahmä, and the\nsame number comprise one night. Brahmä lives one hundred of such “years”\nand then dies. These “hundred years” by earth calculations total to 311 trillion\nand 40 billion earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahmä seems\nfantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a\nlightning flash.

Brahmä and his creation are all\npart of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.\nIn the material universe not even Brahmä is free from the process of birth,\nold age, disease and death. Brahmä, however, is directly engaged in the service\nof the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe—therefore he at\nonce attains liberation. Elevated sannyäsés are promoted to Brahmä’s particular\nplanet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and\nwhich survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary\nsystem, but in due course Brahmä and all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka are\nsubject to death, according to the law of material nature."

There are also trees, called “desire trees,” that\nsupply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows, known as surabhi\ncows, which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served\nby hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lakñmés), and He is called\nGovinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed\nto blow His flute (veëuà kvaëantam). His transcendental form is the most\nattractive in all the worlds—His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His\nbody is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that\nof thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and\na peacock feather in His hair. In the Bhagavad-gétä Lord Kåñëa gives only a\nsmall hint of His personal abode, Goloka Våndävana, which is the supermost\nplanet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the\nBrahma-saàhitä. Vedic literatures (Kaöha Upaniñad 1.3.11) state that there is\nnothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is\nthe ultimate destination (puruñän na paraà kiïcit sä käñöhä paramä gatiù).\nWhen one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. Kåñëa’s\nsupreme abode and Kåñëa Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality.\nOn this earth, Våndävana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that\nsupreme Goloka Våndävana located in the spiritual sky. When Kåñëa\ndescended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as\nVåndävana, comprising about eighty-four square miles in the district of\nMathurä, India"

None is higher than It and so It is the Supreme Person. (Cf.IX.4XI.38XV.6and7)",
        "PurPort": "It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination, from which there is no\nreturn, is the abode of Kåñëa, the Supreme Person.

All the variegatedness manifest there is of\nthe quality of spiritual bliss—nothing there is material. That variegatedness is\nexpanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the\nmanifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter\nSeven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always\nin His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy.\nSo by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere—both in\nthe material and in the spiritual universes. Yasyäntaù-sthäni means that\neverything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material\nenergy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.\nTo enter Kåñëa’s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaikuëöha planets is\npossible only by bhakti, devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the\nword bhaktyä. No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The\nVedas (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 3.2) also describe the supreme abode and the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Eko vaçé sarva-gaù kåñëaù. In that abode\nthere is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is Kåñëa. He is\nthe supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has\nexpanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The Vedas\ncompare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits,\nflowers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside\nover the Vaikuëöha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of\nnames—Puruñottama, Trivikrama, Keçava, Mädhava, Aniruddha, Håñékeça,\nSaìkarñaëa, Pradyumna, Çrédhara, Väsudeva, Dämodara, Janärdana,\nNäräyaëa, Vämana, Padmanäbha, etc.\nThe Brahma-saàhitä (5.37) also confirms that although the Lord is always\nin the supreme abode, Goloka Våndävana, He is all-pervading, so that\neverything is going on nicely (goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù). As stated\nin the Vedas (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.8), paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate/\nsväbhäviké jïäna-bala-kriyä ca: His energies are so expansive that they\nsystematically conduct everything in the cosmic manifestation without a flaw,\nalthough the Supreme Lord is far, far away."

Study of the Vedas\nis not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation\nof character. After this training, the brahmacäré is allowed to enter into\nhousehold life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many\nsacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give\ncharity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among\ncharity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-gétä.\nThen after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of\nvänaprastha, he undergoes severe penances—living in forests, dressing with\ntree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya,\nhouseholder life, vänaprastha and finally sannyäsa, one becomes elevated to\nthe perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly\nkingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in\nthe spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the Vaikuëöha\nplanets or Kåñëaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.\nThe beauty of Kåñëa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by\nengaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different\norders of life.\nThe words idaà viditvä indicate that one should understand the\ninstructions given by Çré Kåñëa in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of\nBhagavad-gétä. One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship\nor mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees.\nChapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-gétä. The first six\nand the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which\nare especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough to understand\nBhagavad-gétä—especially these middle six chapters—in the association of\ndevotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances,\nsacrifices, charities, speculations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of\nthese activities simply by Kåñëa consciousness.\nOne who has a little faith in Bhagavad-gétä should learn Bhagavad-gétä from\na devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly\nthat Bhagavad-gétä can be understood only by devotees; no one else can\nperfectly understand the purpose of Bhagavad-gétä. One should therefore learn\nBhagavad-gétä from a devotee of Kåñëa, not from mental speculators. This is a\nsign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and finally gets a devotee’s\nassociation one actually begins to study and understand Bhagavad-gétä. By\nadvancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional\nservice, and this service dispels all one’s misgivings about Kåñëa, or God, and\nKåñëa’s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these\nmisgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one’s study.\nThen one relishes the study of Bhagavad-gétä and attains the state of feeling\nalways Kåñëa conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love\nwith Kåñëa. This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be\ntransferred to Kåñëa’s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka Våndävana, where the\ndevotee becomes eternally happy.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of Attaining the Supreme"

It can hardly be described in words. It can be realised only through direct experience or spiritual intuition. Atman or Brahman or the selfluminous? eternal? Supreme Purusha is ever shining in the chambers of the hearts of men. Throughout the ages there have always been a few who have trodden the spiritual path and found out this secret or the spiritual treasure of the precious pearl of the Self. Knowledge of the Self is the only direct means for attaining liberation? Karma Yoga purifies the heart and leads to the dawn of the knowledge of the Self.Lord Krishna says? O Arjuna? I shall teach you this profoundest secret knowledge combined with realisation as you are free from jealousy. From this we can clearly understand that freedom from jealousy is an important alification for an aspirant. Knowledge can only dawn in a mind which is free from all forms of jealousy which causes great distraction of the mind and produces intense heartburning. Matsarya (malicious envy)? Irshya (jealous of others prosperity or happiness) and Asuya (envious or indignant over the merits of another) are all varieties of jealousy. If you superimpose evil alities on a virtuous man who really does not possess these alities on a virtuous man who really does not possess these alities and speak ill of him? this is jealousy (Asuya). To behold evil or to look at a person with the faultfinding evil eye? and to see evil in him who is free from any kind of fault and who is virtuous is Asyua. Jealousy is only pettymindedness. This is a modification of ignorance. It can be eradicated by eniry of the nature of the Self and cultivating its opposite alities? viz.? nobility? broad and universal tolerance? magnanimity and largeheartedness.To thee who does not carp or cavil This implies that Arjuna was endowed with all the virtues of a disciple such as straightforwardness? selfcontrol? restraint of the senses? serenity of mind? discrmination? dispassion? etc. This is the Upalakshana (the truth alluded to where only a part is stated) and Asuya is the Upalakshaka (the hint which alludes to the Upalakshana).",
        "PurPort": "As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes\nenlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:\n“The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies,\nand these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead.\nare discussed amongst devotees. This cannot be achieved by the association of\nmental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.”\nThe devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord’s service. The\nLord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who\nis engaged in Kåñëa consciousness and gives him the intelligence to\nunderstand the science of Kåñëa in the association of devotees. Discussion of\nKåñëa is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to\nassimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward\nspiritual realization. Lord Kåñëa, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and\nhigher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters\nmore confidential than any He has already disclosed.\nThe very beginning of Bhagavad-gétä, the First Chapter, is more or less an\nintroduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters,\nthe spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the\nSeventh and Eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and\nbecause they bring enlightenment in Kåñëa consciousness, they are called\nmore confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter\ndeal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most\nconfidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of Kåñëa\nis naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is\nin the material world. In the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu it is said that although\none who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is\nsituated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered\nliberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gétä, Tenth Chapter, that\nanyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.\nNow this first verse has specific significance. The words idaà jïänam (“this\nknowledge”) refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different\nactivities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying,\nobeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice\nof these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual\nconsciousness, Kåñëa consciousness. When one’s heart is thus cleared of\nmaterial contamination, one can understand this science of Kåñëa. Simply to\nunderstand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be.\nthe beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference\nbetween activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who\nunderstands that he is not the body.\nIn the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and\nsuperior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapter Nine the\nglories of the Lord will be delineated.\nThe Sanskrit word anasüyave in this verse is also very significant. Generally\nthe commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of Kåñëa,\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on\nBhagavad-gétä very inaccurately. Because they are envious of Kåñëa, their\ncommentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are\nbona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-gétä or give perfect knowledge of\nKåñëa if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of Kåñëa without\nknowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided.\nFor one who understands that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nthe pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial."

The truth? the sovereign,secret (the Self or the Absolute) can be directly realised by intuition or immediate perception. The science of the Absolute is the most splendid of all sciences. It is the science of sciences. Of sciences the highest? of secrets the most profoun? of purifiers the supreme is this. The knowledge of Brahman is the best purifier. It reduces the roots of all Karmas and all the Karmas themselves which have been stored up in the course of many thousands of births? into ashes in the twinkling of an eye. It destroys Avidya along with its effects. An expiatory act (Prayaschitta) cannot destroy all sins. It removes the effect of a single sin? only to some extent. Even if it is removed the effect of that sin remains in a subtle state in the mind and forces him to do sinful acts in his next birth. But the knowledge of the Self destroys ickly all the sins in their gross and subtle states that are accumulated in the course of several thousands of births along with Avidya? their cause. That is the reason why it is a supreme purifier. The causal body of the Jiva is called MulaAvidya (rootignorance). The Avidya or the veil of ignorance that envelops the visible objects of this world is called Sthula Avidya or gross ignorance.The knowledge of the Self is not opposed to Dharma. It is the fruit of all actions done in many births without expectation of fruits. Further? the knowledge of the Absolute can very easily be attained. One may think that this knowledge will perish soon as it is easily obtained? when its effect is exhausted. It is not so. It is imperishable. It is everlasting. It shines for ever by its own Selfeffulgence. He who has tasted this nectar even once becomes immortal. Therefore the knowledge of the Absolute is certainly worth aciring. You will have to strive very hard to attain it anyhow in this birth? as it is very difficult to get a human birth. Strive hard every moment? for life is uncertain and the prize (final liberation) is great.",
        "PurPort": "This chapter of Bhagavad-gétä is called the king of education because it is\nthe essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. Among the\nprincipal philosophers in India are Gautama, Kaëäda, Kapila, Yäjïavalkya,\nÇäëòilya and Vaiçvänara. And finally there is Vyäsadeva, the author of the\nVedänta-sütra. So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or\ntranscendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the\nking of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived\nfrom the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most\nconfidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves\nunderstanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of\nall confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service.\nGenerally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are\neducated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned,\npeople are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,\nchemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many\ndepartments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but\nthere is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the\nscience of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part\nof the body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still\npeople are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for\nthe vital soul.\nThe Bhagavad-gétä, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the.\nimportance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is\nperishable and that the soul is not perishable (antavanta ime dehä nityasyoktäù\nçarériëaù). That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that the\nspirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable,\nindestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the\nsoul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from\nthe body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body,\nthe soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the\nfact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after\nbeing liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is\neternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most\nconfidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are\ntherefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most\nconfidential part of all knowledge.\nThis knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic\nliterature. In the Padma Puräëa, man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and\nare shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive\nactivities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For\ninstance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear\nimmediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then\nit assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is\ncomplete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the\nseed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes\ntime to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already\nstopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action\nare still to be enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and\nthere are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we\nare enjoying as distress and pain.\nAs explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person\nwho has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully\nengaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world,\nbecomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Kåñëa. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the.\ndevotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions.\nThis statement is confirmed in the Padma Puräëa:\naprärabdha-phalaà päpaà\nküöaà béjaà phalonmukham\nkrameëaiva praléyeta\nviñëu-bhakti-ratätmanäm\nFor those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or\nin the form of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of\ndevotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest.\nUttama means transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness,\nand uttama means that which is transcendental to material activities.\nDevotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes\nit appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see\nand is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material\nactivities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the\nmaterial modes of nature.\nIt is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can\nperceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we\nhave practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of\nKåñëa (Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels\nsome transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material\ncontamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in\nhearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well,\nor if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of Kåñëa\nconsciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in\nspiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or\nqualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one\nbecomes pure.\nIn the Vedänta-sütra (3.2.26) this is also described in the following words:\nprakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät. “Devotional service is so potent that simply by.\nengaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened\nwithout a doubt.” A practical example of this can be seen in the previous life\nof Närada, who in that life happened to be the son of a maidservant. He had\nno education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was\nengaged in serving great devotees, Närada also became engaged, and\nsometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees\nhimself. Närada personally says,\nucchiñöa-lepän anumodito dvijaiù\nsakåt sma bhuïje tad-apästa-kilbiñaù\nevaà pravåttasya viçuddha-cetasas\ntad-dharma evätma-ruciù prajäyate\nIn this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.5.25) Närada describes his previous\nlife to his disciple Vyäsadeva. He says that while engaged as a boy servant for\nthose purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately\nassociating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their\ndishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the\nremnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they\ngave it Närada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all\nsinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as pure-hearted as\nthe sages. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service\nto the Lord by hearing and chanting, and Närada gradually developed the\nsame taste. Närada says further,\ntatränvahaà kåñëa-kathäù pragäyatäm\nanugraheëäçåëavaà manoharäù\ntäù çraddhayä me ’nupadaà viçåëvataù\npriyaçravasy aìga mamäbhavad ruciù\nBy associating with the sages, Närada got the taste for hearing and chanting\nthe glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service.\nTherefore, as described in the Vedänta-sütra, prakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät: if\none is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed\nto him automatically, and he can understand. This is called pratyakña, directly.\nperceived.\nThe word dharmyam means “the path of religion.” Närada was actually a\nson of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply\nassisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the\ndevotees. The child Närada also got the opportunity and simply by association\nachieved the highest goal of all religion. The highest goal of all religion is\ndevotional service, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (sa vai puàsäà paro\ndharmo yato bhaktir adhokñaje). Religious people generally do not know that\nthe highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional service. As\nwe have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight (vedeñu\nyajïeñu tapaùsu caiva), generally Vedic knowledge is required for\nself-realization. But here, although Närada never went to the school of the\nspiritual master and was not educated in the Vedic principles, he acquired the\nhighest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without\nperforming the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest\nperfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature:\näcäryavän puruño veda. One who is in association with great äcäryas, even if he\nis not educated or has never studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all\nthe knowledge necessary for realization.\nThe process of devotional service is a very happy one (susukham). Why?\nDevotional service consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23], so one can\nsimply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical\nlectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized äcäryas. Simply by\nsitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to\nGod, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can\nexecute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The\nLord says, patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam: He is ready to accept from the\ndevotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of\nfruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be\noffered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if\noffered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting the\ntulasé leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumära\nbecame great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it.\ncan be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things\nare offered to Him.\nIt is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as\nthe Mäyävädé philosophers claim. Although they sometimes take to so-called\ndevotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will\ncontinue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated,\nthey will “become one with God.” Such temporary time-serving devotional\nservice is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service\ncontinues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet\nin the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord.\nHe does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.\nAs will be seen in Bhagavad-gétä, actual devotional service begins after\nliberation. After one is liberated, when one is situated in the Brahman\nposition (brahma-bhüta), one’s devotional service begins (samaù sarveñu\nbhüteñu mad-bhaktià labhate paräm). No one can understand the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, añöäìga-yoga or\nany other yoga independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little\nprogress toward bhakti-yoga, but without coming to the stage of devotional\nservice one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by\nexecuting the process of devotional service, especially by hearing\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam or Bhagavad-gétä from realized souls, then he can\nunderstand the science of Kåñëa, or the science of God. Evaà\nprasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti yogataù. When one’s heart is cleared of all\nnonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of\ndevotional service, of Kåñëa consciousness, is the king of all education and the\nking of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can\nbe executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it."

In the\nCaitanya-caritämåta it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply\nby serving the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, one can achieve all perfection. That is\ncalled real faith. As stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (4.31.14),\nyathä taror müla-niñecanena\ntåpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaçäkhäù\npräëopahäräc ca yathendriyäëäà.\ntathaiva sarvärhaëam acyutejyä\n“By giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and\nleaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the\nbody. Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord\none automatically satisfies all the demigods and all other living entities.”\nTherefore, after reading Bhagavad-gétä one should promptly come to the\nconclusion of Bhagavad-gétä: one should give up all other engagements and\nadopt the service of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead. If\none is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.\nNow, the development of that faith is the process of Kåñëa consciousness.\nThere are three divisions of Kåñëa conscious men. In the third class are those\nwho have no faith. Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service,\nthey cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will\nslip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven’t\ncomplete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in\nKåñëa consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our\nmissionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to Kåñëa\nconsciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a\nlittle well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It\nis only by faith that one can advance in Kåñëa consciousness. As far as the\ndevelopment of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of\ndevotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not\nvery advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who\nautomatically have firm faith that kåñëa-bhakti, or service to Kåñëa, is the best\ncourse and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the\nthird class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good\nfaith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second\nclass he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in Kåñëa\nconsciousness there is no chance of falling down. One in the first class will\nsurely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the.\nconviction that devotional service to Kåñëa is very good, he has not yet gained\nadequate knowledge of Kåñëa through the scriptures like Çrémad-Bhägavatam\nand Bhagavad-gétä. Sometimes these third-class persons in Kåñëa consciousness\nhave some tendency toward karma-yoga and jïäna-yoga, and sometimes they\nare disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or jïäna-yoga is\nvanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Faith in Kåñëa is also divided into three stages and described in\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam. First-class attachment, second-class attachment and\nthird-class attachment are also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam in the\nEleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about Kåñëa and\nthe excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find\nthe path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional\nservice. For them there is very little hope of gaining perfection. Thus faith is\nvery important in the discharge of devotional service."

All beings from Brahma? the Creator? down to the blade of grass or an ant? dwell in the transcendental Para Brahman. They have no independent existence they exist through the Self which is the support for everythin? which underlies them all.Nothing here contains It. As Brahman is the Self of all beings? one may imagine that It dwells in them. But it is not so. How could it be How can the Infinite be contained in a finite object Brahman has no connection or contact with any material object? just as a chair or a table has contact with the ground or a man or a book. So It does not dwell in those beings. That which has no connection or contact with objects or beings cannot be contained anywhere as if in a vessel? trunk? room or receptacle. The Self is not rooted in all these forms. It is not contained by any of these forms just as the ether is not contained in any form though all forms are derived from the ether.All beings appear to be living in Brahman? but this is an illusion. If this illusion vanishes? nothing remains anywhere except Brahman. When ignorance? the cause of this illusion? disappears? the very idea of the existence of these beings also will vanish.In verses 4 and 5 the Lord uses a paradox or an apparent contradiction All beings dwell in Me and yet do not dwell in Me I do not dwell in them. For a thinker there is no real contradiction at all. Just as space contains all beings and yet is not touched by them? so also Para Brahman contains everything and yet is not touched by them. Even Mulaprakriti? the source or womb of this world? is supported by Brahman. Brahman has no support or root. It rests in Its own pristine glory. (Cf.VII.12?24VIII.22)",
        "PurPort": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross\nmaterial senses. It is said,\nataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi\nna bhaved grähyam indriyaiù\nsevonmukhe hi jihvädau\nsvayam eva sphuraty adaù\n(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 1.2.234)\nLord Çré Kåñëa’s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by\nmaterial senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under\nproper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-saàhitä (5.38) it is stated,\npremäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti: one\ncan see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself\nand outside himself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude\ntowards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that\nalthough He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the\nmaterial senses. This is indicated here by the word avyakta-mürtinä. But\nactually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we\nhave discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic\nmanifestation is only a combination of His two different energies—the\nsuperior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine\nis spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the\ncreation, and everything is resting in that energy.\nYet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost\nHis personal existence. To refute such an argument the Lord says, “I am\neverywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.” For example, a king\nheads a government which is but the manifestation of the king’s energy; the\ndifferent governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king,.\nand each department is resting on the king’s power. But still one cannot\nexpect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude\nexample. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see and everything that\nexists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the\nenergy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by\nthe diffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä,\nviñöabhyäham idaà kåtsnam: He is everywhere present by His personal\nrepresentation, the diffusion of His different energies."

        "PurPort": "The Lord says that everything is resting on Him (mat-sthäni sarva-bhütäni).\nThis should not be misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the\nmaintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see\na picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired,\nholding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in\nconnection with Kåñëa’s upholding this created universe. He says that\nalthough everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are\nfloating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is\ndifferent from space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says,\n“Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead I am aloof from them.” This is the inconceivable\nopulence of the Lord.\nIn the Nirukti Vedic dictionary it is said, yujyate ’nena durghaöeñu käryeñu:\n“The Supreme Lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes,\ndisplaying His energy.” His person is full of different potent energies, and His\ndetermination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to\nbe understood. We may think of doing something, but there are so many\nimpediments, and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like. But when Kåñëa\nwants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so\nperfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this\nfact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material\nmanifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His\nsupreme will, everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is\nmaintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His\nmind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present\nmaterial mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is\npresent in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also\npresent personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet\neverything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam aiçvaram, the\nmystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Just as the wind ever rests in the ether (space) without any contact or attachment? so also all beings and objects rest in Brahman without any attachment or contact at all. These objects cannot produce any effect on It.What sort of relationship is there between Brahman and the objects of this universe Is it Samyoga? Samavaya or Tadatmya Sambandha The relationship of the stick with the drum is Samyaoga Sambandha. Let us assume that there is such a Sambandha (relationship or connection). There cannot be connection between all the parts because Brahman is infinite and the elements are finite. You may say that there is connection of the Ekadesa type. This is also not possible? because there can be such relationship only between objects which possess members or parts like the tree and monkey. (Ekadesa is partial). Brahman has no parts.If you say that there is Samavaya Sambandha between Brahman and the objects or the elements? this is also not possible. The relationship between the attribute and the possessors of that attribute is called Samavaya Sambandha. The relationship between an individual Brahmin and the whole Brahmin caste is also Samavaya Sambandha. The relationship between hand and man? between the leg and the man is also Samavaya Sambandha. Such relationship does not exist between Brahman and the objects or the elements.The third kind of relationship? viz.? Tadatmya Sambandha is seen to exist between milk and water? fire and the iron ball. Milk shares its alities of sweetness and whiteness with water. Fire shares its alities of brilliance? heat and redness with the hot iron ball. This too is not possible between Brahman and the objects or the elements? because Brahman is ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute and allfull and perfect whereas the elements are insentient? finite and painful. How can they with ite contrary alities have Tadatmya Sambandha with BrahmanTherefore it can be admitted that the elemtns have only got Kalpita Sambandha (superimposition) with Brahman. That object which is superimposed on the substratum or support exists in name only. It does not exist in reality. Brahman is the support or the substratum for this world of names and forms. World here includes all beings and their three kinds of bodies (physical? mental and causal). Therefore? the elements or the beings in this world are not really rooted in Brahman. They do not really dwell in Brahman. It is all in name only.Vayu also means Sutratman or Hiranyagarbha. Bhuta also means the individual consciousness. Just as the ether in the pot is not distinct from the universal ether before the origin and after the destruction of the pot and even when the pot exists? and it is of the nature of the universal soul is of the nature of Brahman during the three periods of time? past? present and future.Just as all efects exist in a state of nondifference in their material cause before they appear? during their period of existence and after their destruction? so also the individual souls are not different from Brahman before the origin of the various limiting adjuncts like mind? intellect? etc.?,during the period of their existence and after their destruction.",
        "PurPort": "For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material\ncreation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help\nus to understand. The sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive.\nAnd in that sky the wind or air is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic\nworld. The movement of the air influences the movements of everything. But\nalthough the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not\nbeyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing\nby the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme\nwill. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the.\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will:\nby His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and\neverything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as the sky is\nalways aloof from the activities of the wind.\nIn the Upaniñads it is stated, yad-bhéñä vätaù pavate: “It is out of the fear of\nthe Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.” (Taittiréya Upaniñad 2.8.1) In the\nBåhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad (3.8.9) it is stated, etasya vä akñarasya praçäsane gärgi\nsürya-candramasau vidhåtau tiñöhata etasya vä akñarasya praçäsane gärgi\ndyäv-äpåthivyau vidhåtau tiñöhataù. “By the supreme order, under the\nsuperintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun,\nand the other great planets are moving.” In the Brahma-saàhitä (5.52) also it is\nstated,\nyac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà\nräjä samasta-sura-mürtir açeña-tejäù\nyasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakro\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\nThis is a description of the movement of the sun. It is said that the sun is\nconsidered to be one of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense\npotency to diffuse heat and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the\norder and the supreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can\nfind evidence that this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very\nwonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead.

The Lord is always neutral in the\nmaterial activities of the created world. This neutrality is mentioned here with\nthe word udäséna-vat. Although He has control over every minute detail of\nmaterial activities, He is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a\nhigh-court judge sitting on his bench. By his order so many things are\nhappening—someone is being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone\nis awarded a huge amount of wealth—but still he is neutral. He has nothing to\ndo with all that gain and loss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although\nHe has His hand in every sphere of activity. In the Vedänta-sütra (2.1.34) it is\nstated, vaiñamya-nairghåëye na: He is not situated in the dualities of this\nmaterial world. He is transcendental to these dualities. Nor is He attached to\nthe creation and annihilation of this material world. The living entities take\ntheir different forms in the various species of life according to their past deeds,\nand the Lord doesn’t interfere with them."

        "PurPort": "It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the\nactivities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme\nLord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation,\nbut the management is being conducted by material nature. Kåñëa also states\nin Bhagavad-gétä that of all of the living entities in different forms and species,\n“I am the father.” The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the\nchild, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living\nentities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different\nforms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living\nentities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, take their\ndifferent bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not\ndirectly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material\nnature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created\nimmediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly\nactivity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the\nmanifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the\nsmåti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched\nby the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are.\ndetached from one another. There is a similar connection between the\nmaterial world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has\nnothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and\nordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme\nPersonality is detached from all material activities."

        "PurPort": "From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is\nclear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a\nhuman being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who.\nconducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic\nmanifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who\nconsider Kåñëa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is\nthe original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä\n(éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù); He is the Supreme Lord.\nThere are many éçvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another.\nIn the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some\nofficial or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a\nminister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is\ncontrolled by another. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that Kåñëa is the\nsupreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the\nmaterial and spiritual world, but Kåñëa is the supreme controller (éçvaraù\nparamaù kåñëaù). and His body is sac-cid-änanda, nonmaterial.\nMaterial bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous\nverses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a\ncommon man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body\nis called here mänuñém because He is acting just like a man, a friend of\nArjuna’s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kurukñetra. In so many ways He\nis acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is\nsac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]—eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is\nconfirmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-änanda-rüpäya kåñëäya: “I offer\nmy obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who is the\neternal blissful form of knowledge.” (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.1) There are\nother descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam ekaà govindam: “You are\nGovinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.” Sac-cid-änanda-vigraham:\n“And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.”\n(Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.35)\nDespite the transcendental qualities of Lord Kåñëa’s body, its full bliss and\nknowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of\nBhagavad-gétä who deride Kåñëa as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born\nan extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of Çré\nKåñëa is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called müòha. for\nonly foolish persons consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being. The.\nfoolish consider Kåñëa an ordinary human being because they do not know the\nconfidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They\ndo not know that Kåñëa’s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss,\nthat He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award\nliberation to anyone. Because they do not know that Kåñëa has so many\ntranscendental qualifications, they deride Him.\nNor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is\nthe master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places\n(mama mäyä duratyayä), He claims that the material energy, although very\npowerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out\nof the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to Kåñëa can get\nout of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who\nconducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic\nnature, have a material body like us? So this conception of Kåñëa is complete\nfoolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of\nGodhead, Kåñëa, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of\nall the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The\nbiggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine\nthat a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite\nand the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the\nfinite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning\nHis yogam aiçvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can\ncontrol the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain\naloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how Kåñëa, who\nappears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those\nwho are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Kåñëa is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and\nengage in Kåñëa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.\nThere are many controversies between the impersonalists and the\npersonalists about the Lord’s appearance as a human being. But if we consult\nBhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam, the authoritative texts for\nunderstanding the science of Kåñëa, then we can understand that Kåñëa is the.\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He\nappeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, First\nCanto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by Çaunaka inquired about the\nactivities of Kåñëa, they said:\nkåtavän kila karmäëi\nsaha rämeëa keçavaù\nati-martyäni bhagavän\ngüòhaù kapaöa-mäëuñaù\n“Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with\nBalaräma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many\nsuperhuman acts.” (Bhäg. 1.1.20) The Lord’s appearance as a man bewilders the\nfoolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that Kåñëa\nperformed while He was present on this earth. When Kåñëa appeared before\nHis father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaké, He appeared with four hands,\nbut after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary\nchild. As stated in the Bhägavatam (10.3.46), babhüva präkåtaù çiçuù: He\nbecame just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again\nit is indicated that the Lord’s appearance as an ordinary human being is one of\nthe features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of\nBhagavad-gétä also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see Kåñëa’s form of four\nhands (tenaiva rüpeëa catur-bhujena). After revealing this form, Kåñëa, when\npetitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (mänuñaà\nrüpam). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those\nof an ordinary human being.\nSome of those who deride Kåñëa and who are infected with the Mäyävädé\nphilosophy quote the following verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (3.29.21) to\nprove that Kåñëa is just an ordinary man. Ahaà sarveñu bhüteñu\nbhütätmävasthitaù sadä: “The Supreme is present in every living entity.” We\nshould better take note of this particular verse from the Vaiñëava äcäryas like\nJéva Gosvämé and Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura instead of following the\ninterpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Kåñëa. Jéva Gosvämé,\ncommenting on this verse, says that Kåñëa, in His plenary expansion as.\nParamätmä, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the\nSupersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the\narcä-mürti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect\nother living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple.\nThere are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the\nlowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the\ntemple than to other devotees, so Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura warns that\nthis sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because\nKåñëa is present in everyone’s heart as Paramätmä, every body is the\nembodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the\ntemple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in\nwhich the Paramätmä dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper\nrespect and should not be neglected.\nThere are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say\nthat since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple\nworship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity?\nAlthough the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another\nperpetually, a perfect devotee in Kåñëa consciousness knows that although\nKåñëa is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in the\nBrahma-saàhitä. Although His personal abode is Goloka Våndävana and He is\nalways staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His\nplenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and\nspiritual creation."

        "PurPort": "There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Kåñëa\nconsciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa, as the Absolute Truth.

Similarly,\nthose who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately\nhoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful\neither, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. In\nother words, persons who mock Kåñëa are to be understood to be demonic or\natheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, such demonic\nmiscreants never surrender to Kåñëa. Therefore their mental speculations to\narrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the\nordinary living entity and Kåñëa are one and the same. With such a false\nconviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply\ncovered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this\nmaterial body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to\nbecome one with Kåñëa will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and\ndemoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the\nindication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the.\nVedic literature, like the Vedänta-sütra and the Upaniñads. is always baffled.\nIt is a great offense, therefore, to consider Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded\nbecause they cannot understand the eternal form of Kåñëa. The\nBåhad-viñëu-småti clearly states:\nyo vetti bhautikaà dehaà\nkåñëasya paramätmanaù\nsa sarvasmäd bahiñ-käryaù\nçrauta-smärta-vidhänataù\nmukhaà tasyävalokyäpi\nsa-celaà snänam äcaret\n“One who considers the body of Kåñëa to be material should be driven out\nfrom all rituals and activities of the çruti and the småti. And if one by chance\nsees his face, one should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of\ninfection. People jeer at Kåñëa because they are envious of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in\nthe species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge\nwill remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest\nregion of creation.”"

All these rules and\nregulations are offered by the great äcäryas for those who are actually\ninterested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead in the transcendental world. The mahätmäs, great souls, strictly\nobserve all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve\nthe desired result.\nAs described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional\nservice easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to\nundergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional\nservice, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a\nhouseholder or a sannyäsé or a brahmacäré; in any position and anywhere in\nthe world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead and thus become actually mahätmä, a great soul."

How can existence come out of nonexistence It is simply absurd to conceive that existence has arisen out of nonexistence (nothing).For a Vedantin ( student or follower of Vedanta) Brahman (the Absolute) is Sat (existence) because It always exists and because It is unchanging. This manifested world is Asat or unreal. For the worldlyminded people who have neither understanding nor knowledge of Brahman? who are endowed with gross and impure mind? who do not have a sharp and subtle intellect? and who ca perceive the gross forms only? this manifested world is the Sat and the subtle unmanifested MulaPrakriti (the primordial Nature)? the cause of this manifested world? is Asat.

From this seedbody have sprung the subtle and the gross bodies. Take the case of an orange. The outer skin is its physical body the inner pulp or essence is the subtle body the innermost causal body which gives rise to the pulp and the outer skin is the seed.

The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of\nour life is Kåñëa, and Kåñëa meets us at the end as death.

In the advanced stage of Kåñëa consciousness, one therefore makes\nno such distinctions.

The purport is that instead of being elevated to the spiritual world, from\nwhich there is no longer any possibility of coming down, one simply revolves\nin the cycle of birth and death on higher and lower planetary systems. One\nshould better take to the spiritual world to enjoy an eternal life full of bliss and\nknowledge and never return to this miserable material existence."

These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion\nof the Vedas, which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on\ndifferent heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the Pitä planets by\nperforming a specific yajïa. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and\nbecome a Yakña, Rakña or Piçäca. Piçäca worship is called “black arts” or “black\nmagic.” There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it\nis spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure\ndevotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the\nplanets of Vaikuëöha and Kåñëaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to\nunderstand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the\ndemigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the Pitäs\nachieve the Pitä planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly\nplanets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Kåñëa or Viñëu?\nUnfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets\nwhere Kåñëa and Viñëu live, and because they do not know of them they fall\ndown. Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti. The Kåñëa.\nconsciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the\nentire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Kåñëa\nmantra one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to\nGodhead.\n"

        "PurPort": "For the intelligent person, it is essential to be in Kåñëa consciousness,\nengaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, in order to achieve a\npermanent, blissful abode for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such\na marvelous result is very easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the\npoor, without any kind of qualification. The only qualification required in this.\nconnection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does not matter what one is\nor where one is situated. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water\nor fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will\nbe pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred from Kåñëa\nconsciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such a fool that he\ndoes not want to be Kåñëa conscious by this simple method and thus attain the\nhighest perfectional life of eternity, bliss and knowledge? Kåñëa wants only\nloving service and nothing more. Kåñëa accepts even a little flower from His\npure devotee. He does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee. He is\nnot in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He\naccepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To\ndevelop Kåñëa consciousness is the highest perfection of life. Bhakti is\nmentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that\nbhakti, or devotional service, is the only means to approach Kåñëa. No other\ncondition, such as becoming a brähmaëa. a learned scholar, a very rich man or\na great philosopher, can induce Kåñëa to accept some offering. Without the\nbasic principle of bhakti, nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept\nanything from anyone. Bhakti is never causal. The process is eternal. It is\ndirect action in service to the absolute whole.\nHere Lord Kåñëa, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the\nprimeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types\nof sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional\nservice to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of\nlife—the transcendental loving service of God—then one should find out\nwhat the Lord desires of him. One who loves Kåñëa will give Him whatever He\nwants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus\nmeat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Kåñëa. If He desired such things as\nofferings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit,\nflowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, “I will accept\nit.” Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and\neggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human\nbeings and are prescribed by Lord Kåñëa Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot\nbe offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the.\nlevel of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\nIn the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, Çré Kåñëa explains that only the\nremains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are\nseeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material\nentanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the\nsame verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply\ndeepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But\npreparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or\nDeity of Lord Kåñëa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a\nhumble offering enables one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and\nto create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the\noffering should be made with an attitude of love. Kåñëa has no need of food,\nsince He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering\nof one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in\npreparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Kåñëa.\nThe impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute\nTruth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gétä. To\nthem, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kåñëa, the\nspeaker of the Bhagavad-gétä. But, in actuality, Kåñëa, the Supreme Godhead,\nhas senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words,\none sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say\nthat Kåñëa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all\nopulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kåñëa has explained that He impregnates\nthe living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon\nmaterial nature. And so in this instance, Kåñëa’s hearing the devotee’s words\nof love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually\ntasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His\nhearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who\naccepts Kåñëa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand\nthat the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it."

This is further explained by Rüpa\nGosvämé as follows:\nanäsaktasya viñayän.\nyathärham upayuïjataù\nnirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe\nyuktaà vairägyam ucyate\n(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu 2.255)\nRüpa Gosvämé says that as long as we are in this material world we have to\nact; we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits\nare given to Kåñëa, then that is called yukta-vairägya. Actually situated in\nrenunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor\ngradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely\nsurrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he\nbecomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he\ndoes not become one with the brahmajyoti, but rather enters into the planet of\nthe Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: mäm upaiñyasi, “he comes to\nMe,” back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation,\nand here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here\nunder the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point\nwhere he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly\nin the association of the Supreme Lord.\nAnyone who has no interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the\nLord is actually a sannyäsé. Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal\nservant, dependent on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he\ndoes, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he\nperforms it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the\nfruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary\npersons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the\nVedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of\nthe Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties,\nactually it is not so.\nIt is said, therefore, by Vaiñëava authorities that even the most intelligent\nperson cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact\nwords are täìra väkya, kriyä, mudrä vijïeha nä bujhaya (Caitanya-caritämåta,\nMadhya 23.39). A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord\nor is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered.\ncompletely liberated at present, and in the future his going back home, back to\nGodhead, is guaranteed. He is above all materialistic criticism, just as Kåñëa is\nabove all criticism."

        "PurPort": "One may question here that if Kåñëa is equal to everyone and no one is His\nspecial friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are\nalways engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it\nis natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet.\nhe has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living\nentity—in whatever form—is His son, and so He provides everyone with a\ngenerous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours\nrain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His\ndevotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they\nare always in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore they are always\ntranscendentally situated in Kåñëa. The very phrase “Kåñëa consciousness”\nsuggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists,\nsituated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, mayi te: “They are in Me.”\nNaturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also\nexplains the words ye yathä mäà prapadyante täàs tathaiva bhajämy aham:\n“Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.” This\ntranscendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are\nconscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold\nis glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the\nliving entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the\nservice of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so\nthis combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called\ndevotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a\nreciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then\nthere is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no\nreciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the\npersonalist philosophy there is.\nThe example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever\none wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is\nmore complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is\nthe manifestation of the Lord’s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord’s\nreciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It\nbelongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees\nfunction. Devotional service to the Lord is not an activity of this material\nworld; it is part of the spiritual world, where eternity, bliss and knowledge\npredominate."

(Cf.IV.36)",
        "PurPort": "The word su-duräcäraù used in this verse is very significant, and we should\nunderstand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds\nof activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for\nprotecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there\nare different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the\nconditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the\nliving entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in\nKåñëa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which.\nare called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional\nposition, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the\nconditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in\nrelation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these\nactivities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very\ncautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome\ncondition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his\nprogressive realization of Kåñëa consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be\nseen that a person in Kåñëa consciousness commits some act which may be\ntaken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown\ndoes not disqualify him. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that if a person\nfalls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the\nSupreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and\nexcuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong\nthat even a yogé fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes\nensnared; but Kåñëa consciousness is so strong that such an occasional\nfalldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is\nalways a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown\nfrom the ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional\nfalldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely\nsituated in Kåñëa consciousness.\nTherefore a person who is situated in Kåñëa consciousness and is engaged\nwith determination in the process of chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa\nKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be\nconsidered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident\nhe is found to have fallen. The words sädhur eva, “he is saintly,” are very\nemphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an\naccidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be\nconsidered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the word\nmantavyaù is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a\ndevotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the\nSupreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and\nexclusively engaged in devotional service..\nIn the Nåsiàha Puräëa the following statement is given:\nbhagavati ca haräv ananya-cetä\nbhåça-malino ’pi viräjate manuñyaù\nna hi çaça-kaluña-cchabiù kadäcit\ntimira-paräbhavatäm upaiti candraù\nThe meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of\nthe Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities\nshould be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on\nthe moon. Such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of\nmoonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of\nsaintly character does not make him abominable.\nOn the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in\ntranscendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this\nverse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material\nconnections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the\nillusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory\nenergy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he\nis no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one\nshould take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is\nstill a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service,\nthen it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee."

One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications\nwhatsoever. The question remains, then, How can a person engaged in\nabominable activities—either by accident or by intention—be a pure devotee?\nThis question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh\nChapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good\nqualifications, as is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. Generally, a devotee who\nis engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process\nof cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are\nnaturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him\npure by nature. According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if\none falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic\nprocesses to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the\npurifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his\nremembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the\nchanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage..\nThis will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns.

Everyone is\neligible for the supreme destination. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (2.4.18) it is.\nstated that even the lowest, who are called caëòälas (dog-eaters), can be\npurified by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and\nthe guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination\nbetween the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it.

Those lower than\nthem are called caëòälas, and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the\nassociation of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher\nclasses. But the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee\nof the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the\nhighest perfection of life.

One\nshould be thinking of Kåñëa in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should\ncultivate the knowledge of Kåñëa continuously. What is that favorable\ncultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. Kåñëa is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is\nnot material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about Kåñëa\nwill help one become a devotee. Understanding Kåñëa otherwise, from the\nwrong source, will prove fruitless.\nOne should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form\nof Kåñëa; with conviction in his heart that Kåñëa is the Supreme, he should\nengage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in\nIndia for the worship of Kåñëa, and devotional service is practiced there.\nWhen such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to Kåñëa. One should\nlower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his\nactivities—everything. That will make one fully absorbed in Kåñëa without\ndeviation. This will help one transfer to the Kåñëaloka. One should not be\ndeviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine\ndifferent processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting\nabout Kåñëa. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human\nsociety.\nThe Seventh and Eighth chapters of Bhagavad-gétä have explained pure\ndevotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic\nyoga and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be\nattracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahmajyoti and\nlocalized Paramätmä, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the\nSupreme Lord.\nThere is a beautiful poem about Kåñëa in which it is clearly stated that any.\nperson who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and\ncannot achieve at any time the supreme award of Kåñëa. The devotee, in the\nbeginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be\nconsidered superior to all other philosophers and yogés. One who always\nengages in Kåñëa consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly\nperson. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon\nbe situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no\nactual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes\ncare of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take\ndirectly to the process of Kåñëa consciousness and happily live in this material\nworld. He will eventually receive the supreme award of Kåñëa.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.\n"

While\nKåñëa was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore\ngreat sages like Paräçara Muni have all accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Now Kåñëa is instructing Arjuna in more confidential\nknowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the\nSeventh Chapter, the Lord has already explained His different energies and\nhow they are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to\nArjuna. In the previous chapter He has clearly explained His different\nenergies to establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He\ntells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.\nThe more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed\nin devotional service.

Here it is also stated by the\nLord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the\ndemigods and great sages cannot understand Kåñëa; they can understand\nneither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called.\nscholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God\ncomes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful,\nuncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the\nqualification necessary to understand Kåñëa. Even the demigods and the great\nsages have tried to understand Kåñëa by their mental speculation, and they\nhave failed to do so. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is clearly said that even\nthe great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can\nreach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested\nby the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by\nmental speculation, but it is not possible to understand Kåñëa by such foolish\nspeculation.\nHere the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute\nTruth, “Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the\nSupreme.” One should know this. Although one cannot understand the\ninconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can\nactually understand Kåñëa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply\nby studying His words in Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The\nconception of God as some ruling power or as the impersonal Brahman can be\nreached by persons who are in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the\nPersonality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the\ntranscendental position.\nBecause most men cannot understand Kåñëa in His actual situation, out of\nHis causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite\nthe Supreme Lord’s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to\ncontamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman\nis the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme\nLord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is\nKåñëa. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman\nconception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender\nimmediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kåñëa\nthey can understand Kåñëa. No one else can understand Him. So even great\nsages agree: What is ätmä, what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to.\nworship."

Just as burnt seeds cannot germinate? so also the burnt Samskaras cannot generate further actions or future births.For the following reason also? I am the great Lord of the worlds.",
        "PurPort": "As stated in the Seventh Chapter (7.3), manuñyäëäà sahasreñu kaçcid yatati\nsiddhaye: those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of\nspiritual realization are not ordinary men; they are superior to millions and\nmillions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization. But\nout of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who\ncan come to the understanding that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful\nspiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully understood.\nKåñëa’s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.\nHere the Lord is described by the word aja, meaning “unborn,” but He is\ndistinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as\naja. The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and\ndying due to material attachment. The conditioned souls are changing their\nbodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material\nworld, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said\nthat the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior, material\nenergy, but is always in the superior energy.\nIn this verse the words vetti loka-maheçvaram indicate that one should know\nthat Lord Kåñëa is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the\nuniverse. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His\ncreation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far\nas Kåñëa is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Kåñëa is\ndifferent even from the great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva. And because He\nis the creator of Brahmä, Çiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme\nPerson of all planets.\nÇré Kåñëa is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone\nwho knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful\nreactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the\nknowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known\nand not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä.\nOne should not try to understand Kåñëa as a human being. As stated\npreviously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again\nexpressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent\nenough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always\nfree from all sinful reactions.\nIf Kåñëa is known as the son of Devaké, then how can He be unborn? That\nis also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam: When He appeared before Devaké\nand Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His\noriginal form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.\nAnything done under the direction of Kåñëa is transcendental. It cannot be\ncontaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious..\nThe conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the\nmaterial world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing\nauspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very\nmaterial nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real\nauspiciousness depends on activities in Kåñëa consciousness in full devotion\nand service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we\nshould work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are\ngiven in authoritative scriptures such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam and\nBhagavad-gétä, or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual\nmaster is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the\ndirection of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and\nscriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three\nsources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of\npious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude\nof the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation,\nand this is called sannyäsa. As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter of\nBhagavad-gétä, one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to\ndo so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his\nactivities (anäçritaù karma-phalam), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under\nthe direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyäsé and a yogé, and not the\nman who has simply taken the dress of the sannyäsé, or a pseudo yogé."

Commentary Intellect is the power which the Antahkarana (the fourfold inner instrument -- the mind? the subconscious mind? intellect and egoism) has of understanding subtle objects. Wisdom is knowledge of the Self. Nondelusion is freedom from illusion. It consists in acting with discrimination when anything has to be done or kown at the moment. Patience is the nonagitation of the mind when assaulted or abused. Not thinking of any harm of evil for those who ahve assulted or abused is also patience. Patience is enduring without lamentation the three kinds of pains? Adhyatmika? Adhidaivika and Adhibhautika Taapas. Fever? etc.? is Adhyatmika pain. Pain or discomfort from severe cold? heat? too much rain? thunder? and lightning is Adhidaivika pain.

It is withdrawal of the senses (ear? skin? eyes? tongue and nose) from their respective objects (viz.? sound? touch? form? palatable foods and fragrance). Sama is calmness or tranillity of the mind produced by checking the mind from thinking of external objects of the senses and by disconnecting it from the senses.Sukham Happiness.

Duhkham That which has Adhrama as its cause and that which is unfavourable to all beings? is pain.That which appears is Bhavah. Sat is Bhavah. Asat or unreality is Abhavah.",
        "PurPort": "The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created\nby Kåñëa, and they are described here.\nIntelligence refers to the power to analyze things in their proper\nperspective, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is\nmatter. Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only\nto matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means.\nknowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there\nis no knowledge about spirit; they are simply taking care of the material\nelements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.\nAsammoha, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is\nnot hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly\nbut surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted\nblindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. Kñamä,\ntolerance and forgiveness, should be practiced; one should be tolerant and\nexcuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts\nshould be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts should not be\nmisrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak\nthe truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The\ntruth should be spoken in a straightforward way, so that others will understand\nactually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he\nis a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one\nshould not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be\npresented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.\nControl of the senses means that the senses should not be used for\nunnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the\nproper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for\nspiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from\nunnecessary use. Similarly, one should restrain the mind from unnecessary\nthoughts; that is called çama. One should not spend one’s time pondering over\nearning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be\nused to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be\npresented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in\nassociation with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons\nand spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham,\npleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the\ncultivation of the spiritual knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. And similarly,\nthat which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for\nthe cultivation of Kåñëa consciousness. Anything favorable for the\ndevelopment of Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted, and anything.\nunfavorable should be rejected.\nBhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is\nconcerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the\nbeginning of Bhagavad-gétä. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the\nmaterial world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in Kåñëa\nconsciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the\nspiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright.\nOthers, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no\nknowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant\nanxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to\nunderstand Kåñëa and be situated always in Kåñëa consciousness. In that way\nwe will be free from all fear. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.2.37) it is stated,\nbhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät: fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory\nenergy. But those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are\nconfident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who are therefore engaged in the\ntranscendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their\nfuture is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Abhayam, fearlessness, is possible only for one in Kåñëa\nconsciousness.\nAhiàsä, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will\nput others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so\nmany politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good\nresults because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental\nvision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiàsä\nmeans that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of\nthe human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual\nrealization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that\nend commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future\nspiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.\nSamatä, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be\nvery much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material\nworld should be accepted without attachment or aversion. That which is.\nfavorable for prosecuting Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted; that which\nis unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatä, equanimity. A person\nin Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in\nterms of its usefulness in the prosecution of Kåñëa consciousness.\nTuñöi, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and\nmore material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with\nwhatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called\nsatisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and\nregulations in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and\ntaking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning,\nbut whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance.\nSimilarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One\nmay not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination\nto make advancement in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, he should accept\nsuch bodily troubles when they are recommended. However, one should not\nfast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some\npolitical purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gétä as fasting in ignorance,\nand anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual\nadvancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one,\nhowever, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in\nspiritual knowledge.\nAs far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings\nto some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in\nterms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause.\nBecause Kåñëa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a\nperson who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic literature,\nit is enjoined that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. This practice is\nstill followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But\nstill the injunction is that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. Why?\nBecause they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A\nbrähmaëa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman.\nBrahma jänätéti brähmaëaù: one who knows Brahman is called a brähmaëa.\nThus charity is offered to the brähmaëas because they are always engaged in.\nhigher spiritual service and have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic\nliterature, charity is also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life,\nthe sannyäsé. The sannyäsés beg from door to door, not for money but for\nmissionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken\nthe householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are\nengaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in\nlife—awakening their Kåñëa consciousness—it is the business of the sannyäsés\nto go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be Kåñëa\nconscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due\nhim in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by\nthe sannyäsés; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the\nbrähmaëas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.\nYaças, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is\nfamous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has\nbecome a great man in Kåñëa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly\nfamous. One who does not have such fame is infamous.\nAll these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society\nand in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on\nother planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to\nadvance in Kåñëa consciousness, Kåñëa creates all these qualities, but the\nperson develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional\nservice of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the\nSupreme Lord.\nOf whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kåñëa. Nothing can\nmanifest itself in this material world which is not in Kåñëa. That is knowledge;\nalthough we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that\neverything flows from Kåñëa"

        "EngMeaning": "10.5 Non-injury, eanimity, contentment, austerity, beneficence, fame, ill-fame  (these) different kinds of alities of beings arise from Me alone.",
        "WordMeaning": "10.5 अहिंसा noninjury? समता eanimity? तुष्टिः contentment? तपः austerity? दानम् beneficence? यशः fame? अयशः illfame? भवन्ति arise? भावाः alities? भूतानाम् of beings? मत्तः from Me? एव alone? पृथग्विधाः of different kinds. Commentary Ahimsa is noninjury to living beings in thought? word and deed. Samata is that state wherein there is neither Raga (like) nor Dvesha (dislike)? when one gets pleasant or unpleasant objects. There is neither exhilaration when one gets pleasant or favourable objects nor depressions when one gets unpleasant or unfavourable objects. Tushtih is satisfaction or contentment. The man of contentment is satisfied with whatever object he gets through Prarabdha. He is satisfied with his present acisitions. He is free from greed and so he has peace of mind. Contentment makes a man very rich. It annihilates greed. Greed makes even a rich man a beggar of beggars. A greedy man is ever restless. Tapas is restraint of the senses? with bodily mortification through the practice of fasting and slow reduction of food. The strength of the body and the senses is reduced through fasting.Danam is beneficence. It is sharing of ones own things with others according to ones own means? or distribution of rice? gold? cloth? etc.? to a worthy person? in a fit place and time? especially to one who can do nothign in return.Yasas is fame due to Dharma or virtuous actions.Ayasah is illfame or disgrace due to Adharma or sinful actions.All these different kinds of alities of living beings arise from Me alone? the great Lord of the worlds? according to their respective Karmas.",
        "PurPort": "The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created\nby Kåñëa, and they are described here.\nIntelligence refers to the power to analyze things in their proper\nperspective, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is\nmatter. Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only\nto matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means.\nknowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there\nis no knowledge about spirit; they are simply taking care of the material\nelements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.\nAsammoha, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is\nnot hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly\nbut surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted\nblindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. Kñamä,\ntolerance and forgiveness, should be practiced; one should be tolerant and\nexcuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts\nshould be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts should not be\nmisrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak\nthe truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The\ntruth should be spoken in a straightforward way, so that others will understand\nactually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he\nis a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one\nshould not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be\npresented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.\nControl of the senses means that the senses should not be used for\nunnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the\nproper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for\nspiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from\nunnecessary use. Similarly, one should restrain the mind from unnecessary\nthoughts; that is called çama. One should not spend one’s time pondering over\nearning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be\nused to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be\npresented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in\nassociation with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons\nand spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham,\npleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the\ncultivation of the spiritual knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. And similarly,\nthat which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for\nthe cultivation of Kåñëa consciousness. Anything favorable for the\ndevelopment of Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted, and anything.\nunfavorable should be rejected.\nBhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is\nconcerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the\nbeginning of Bhagavad-gétä. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the\nmaterial world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in Kåñëa\nconsciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the\nspiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright.\nOthers, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no\nknowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant\nanxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to\nunderstand Kåñëa and be situated always in Kåñëa consciousness. In that way\nwe will be free from all fear. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (11.2.37) it is stated,\nbhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät: fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory\nenergy. But those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are\nconfident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who are therefore engaged in the\ntranscendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their\nfuture is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Abhayam, fearlessness, is possible only for one in Kåñëa\nconsciousness.\nAhiàsä, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will\nput others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so\nmany politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good\nresults because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental\nvision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiàsä\nmeans that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of\nthe human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual\nrealization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that\nend commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future\nspiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.\nSamatä, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be\nvery much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material\nworld should be accepted without attachment or aversion. That which is.\nfavorable for prosecuting Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted; that which\nis unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatä, equanimity. A person\nin Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in\nterms of its usefulness in the prosecution of Kåñëa consciousness.\nTuñöi, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and\nmore material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with\nwhatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called\nsatisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and\nregulations in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and\ntaking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning,\nbut whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance.\nSimilarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One\nmay not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination\nto make advancement in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, he should accept\nsuch bodily troubles when they are recommended. However, one should not\nfast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some\npolitical purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gétä as fasting in ignorance,\nand anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual\nadvancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one,\nhowever, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in\nspiritual knowledge.\nAs far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings\nto some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in\nterms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause.\nBecause Kåñëa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a\nperson who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic literature,\nit is enjoined that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. This practice is\nstill followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But\nstill the injunction is that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. Why?\nBecause they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A\nbrähmaëa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman.\nBrahma jänätéti brähmaëaù: one who knows Brahman is called a brähmaëa.\nThus charity is offered to the brähmaëas because they are always engaged in.\nhigher spiritual service and have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic\nliterature, charity is also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life,\nthe sannyäsé. The sannyäsés beg from door to door, not for money but for\nmissionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken\nthe householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are\nengaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in\nlife—awakening their Kåñëa consciousness—it is the business of the sannyäsés\nto go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be Kåñëa\nconscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due\nhim in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by\nthe sannyäsés; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the\nbrähmaëas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.\nYaças, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is\nfamous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has\nbecome a great man in Kåñëa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly\nfamous. One who does not have such fame is infamous.\nAll these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society\nand in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on\nother planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to\nadvance in Kåñëa consciousness, Kåñëa creates all these qualities, but the\nperson develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional\nservice of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the\nSupreme Lord.\nOf whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kåñëa. Nothing can\nmanifest itself in this material world which is not in Kåñëa. That is knowledge;\nalthough we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that\neverything flows from Kåñëa"

        "PurPort": "A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information\nfrom authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these\nteachings can understand that Kåñëa is the origin of everything in both the\nmaterial and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes\nfirmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be\ndeviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic\nliterature agrees that Kåñëa is the source of Brahmä, Çiva and all other\ndemigods. In the Atharva Veda (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.24) it is said, yo\nbrahmäëaà vidadhäti pürvaà yo vai vedäàç ca gäpayati sma kåñëaù: “It was\nKåñëa who in the beginning instructed Brahmä in Vedic knowledge and who\ndisseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.” Then again the Näräyaëa\nUpaniñad (1) says, atha puruño ha vai näräyaëo ’kämayata prajäù såjeyeti: “Then\nthe Supreme Personality Näräyaëa desired to create living entities.” The\nUpaniñad continues, näräyaëäd brahmä jäyate, näräyaëäd prajäpatiù prajäyate,\nnäräyaëäd indro jäyate, näräyaëäd añöau vasavo jäyante, näräyaëäd ekädaça\nrudrä jäyante, näräyaëäd dvädaçädityäù: “From Näräyaëa, Brahmä is born, and\nfrom Näräyaëa the patriarchs are also born. From Näräyaëa, Indra is born,\nfrom Näräyaëa the eight Vasus are born, from Näräyaëa the eleven Rudras are\nborn, from Näräyaëa the twelve Ädityas are born.” This Näräyaëa is an\nexpansion of Kåñëa.\nIt is said in the same Vedas, brahmaëyo devaké-putraù: “The son of Devaké,\nKåñëa, is the Supreme Personality.” (Näräyaëa Upaniñad 4) Then it is said, eko\nvai näräyaëa äsén na brahmä na éçäno näpo nägni-samau neme dyäv-äpåthivé na\nnakñaträëi na süryaù: “In the beginning of the creation there was only the\nSupreme Personality Näräyaëa. There was no Brahmä, no Çiva, no water, no.\nfire, no moon, no stars in the sky, no sun.” (Mahä Upaniñad 1) In the Mahä\nUpaniñad it is also said that Lord Çiva was born from the forehead of the\nSupreme Lord. Thus the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of\nBrahmä and Çiva, who is to be worshiped.\nIn the Mokña-dharma Kåñëa also says,\nprajäpatià ca rudraà cäpy\naham eva såjämi vai\ntau hi mäà na vijänéto\nmama mäyä-vimohitau\n“The patriarchs, Çiva and others are created by Me, though they do not\nknow that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory\nenergy.” In the Varäha Puräëa it is also said,\nnäräyaëaù paro devas\ntasmäj jätaç caturmukhaù\ntasmäd rudro ’bhavad devaù\nsa ca sarva-jïatäà gataù\n“Näräyaëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahmä\nwas born, from whom Çiva was born.”\nLord Kåñëa is the source of all generations, and He is called the most\nefficient cause of everything. He says, “Because everything is born of Me, I am\nthe original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.” There\nis no supreme controller other than Kåñëa. One who understands Kåñëa in\nsuch a way from a bona fide spiritual master, with references from Vedic\nliterature, engages all his energy in Kåñëa consciousness and becomes a truly\nlearned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know Kåñëa\nproperly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary\nman. A Kåñëa conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should\navoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-gétä and\nproceed in Kåñëa consciousness with determination and firmness."

Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours\ndaily engaged in glorifying the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord.\nTheir hearts and souls are constantly submerged in Kåñëa, and they take\npleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.\nIn the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the.\ntranscendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they\nare actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental\nposition, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord\nin His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the\nsowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living\nentities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of\nthem there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get\nthe chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just\nlike a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on\nhearing and chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare\nRäma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed\nof a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional\nservice gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the\nmaterial universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual\nsky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches\nthe highest planet, which is called Goloka Våndävana, the supreme planet of\nKåñëa. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of Kåñëa and\nrests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of\ndevotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of\nchanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully\ndescribed in the Caitanya-caritämåta (Madhya-lélä, Chapter Nineteen). It is\nexplained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus\nfeet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he\ncannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme\nLord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee\nactually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.\nThe Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also full of such narrations about the\nrelationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the Bhägavatam\nitself (12.13.18). Çrémad-bhägavataà puräëam amalaà yad vaiñëavänäà priyam.\nIn this narration there is nothing about material activities, economic\ndevelopment, sense gratification or liberation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the only\nnarration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His.\ndevotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in Kåñëa consciousness take\ncontinual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young\nboy and girl take pleasure in association."

(Cf.IV.39XII.6and7)Why does the Lord impart this Yoga of knowledge to His devotees What obstacles does the Buddhi Yoga remove on the path of the aspirant or devotee The Lord gives the answer in the following verse.",
        "PurPort": "In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember\nthat in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had\nspoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of\nbuddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yoga itself is action in\nKåñëa consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means\nintelligence, and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one.\ntries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Kåñëa consciousness\nin devotional service, his action is called buddhi yoga. In other words,\nbuddhi-yoga is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this\nmaterial world. The ultimate goal of progress is Kåñëa. People do not know\nthis; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are\nimportant. One should know that the goal is Kåñëa, and when the goal is\nassigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate\ngoal is achieved.\nWhen a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of\nactivities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is Kåñëa\nbut he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand Kåñëa, he is acting\nin jïäna-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks Kåñëa completely in\nKåñëa consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or\nbuddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest\nperfectional stage of life.\nA person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a\nspiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress,\nthen Kåñëa from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come\nto Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage\nhimself in Kåñëa consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of\nservices. He should perform some sort of work for Kåñëa, and that work should\nbe with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the\npath of self-realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of\ndevotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and\nultimately attain to Him."

        "PurPort": "When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare\nKåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma\nRäma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prakäçänanda\nSarasvaté, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time,\nderided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers\ncriticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the\ndarkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually\nthat is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put\nforward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take\nadvantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his\ndevotional service he is helped by Kåñëa Himself within his heart. So the\nsincere devotee engaged in Kåñëa consciousness cannot be without knowledge.\nThe only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full Kåñëa\nconsciousness.\nThe modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot\nhave pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord:\nthose who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be.\nwithout sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the\nVedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.\nThe Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding\nthe Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nsimply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible\nto understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man\ncan go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if\nhe is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kåñëa, or the\nSupreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa,\npleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of\nthe pure devotee. The pure devotee always has Kåñëa within his heart; and\nwith the presence of Kåñëa, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance\nis at once dissipated. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by\nKåñëa.\nDue to the contamination of material association, through many, many\nmillions of births, one’s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism,\nbut when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Kåñëa,\nthe dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge.\nThe ultimate goal, Viñëu, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional\nservice, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not\nhave to worry about the material necessities of life; he need not be anxious,\nbecause when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided\nautomatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional\nservice of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gétä. By\nstudying Bhagavad-gétä, one can become a soul completely surrendered to the\nSupreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord\ntakes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic\nendeavors."

Bhagavad-gétä is the statement of Kåñëa, and since it is the\nscience of Kåñëa, it should be understood from Kåñëa as Arjuna understood it.\nIt should not be received from atheistic persons.\nAs stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11):\nvadanti tat tattva-vidas\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam\nbrahmeti paramätmeti\nbhagavän iti çabdyate\nThe Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman,\nlocalized Paramätmä and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at\nthe last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has.\nrealized impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä may not understand\nGod’s personality. Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the\nSupreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-gétä, which are being spoken by\nthis person, Kåñëa. Sometimes the impersonalists accept Kåñëa as Bhagavän, or\nthey accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand\nKåñëa as Puruñottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him\nas Puruñottama. Yet one still may not understand that Kåñëa is the father of all\nliving entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bhüta-bhävana. And if one\ncomes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not\nknow Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as\nBhüteça, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows Kåñëa as\nthe supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is\nthe origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva,\nthe worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the\nworshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme\nproprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth\nabout Kåñëa is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we\nshould follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kåñëa as He is."

        "PurPort": "As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nis covered by His yoga-mäyä. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see\nHim. Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Kåñëa, is the Supreme\nGodhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading\nLord can be understood by the common man. Common men, including the\ndemons and atheists, cannot know Kåñëa, because He is guarded by His\nyoga-mäyä energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their\nbenefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding\nbut for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because\nhe is a Vaiñëava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding\nof the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses Kåñëa specifically\nas yogin because Çré Kåñëa is the master of the yoga-mäyä energy, by which He\nis covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no\nlove for Kåñëa cannot always think of Kåñëa; therefore he has to think\nmaterially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic\npersons of this world. The words keñu keñu ca bhäveñu refer to material nature\n(the word bhäva means “physical things”). Because materialists cannot\nunderstand Kåñëa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on\nphysical things and try to see how Kåñëa is manifested by physical\nrepresentations."

Those\nwho have entered into a transcendental relationship with Kåñëa relish at every.\nstep the descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.” (Çrémad-Bhägavatam 1.1.19)\nThus Arjuna is interested in hearing about Kåñëa, and specifically how He\nremains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.\nNow as far as amåtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement\nconcerning Kåñëa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by\npractical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from\nthe transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing\nmundane stories but one never tires of hearing about Kåñëa. It is for this\nreason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to\nthe pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. The Puräëas are histories of\nbygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In\nthis way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings."

Still the devotees try to understand\nKåñëa, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand Kåñëa fully\nat any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of Kåñëa are\nso relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar. Thus the devotees\nenjoy them. In discussing Kåñëa’s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure\ndevotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and\ndiscuss them. Kåñëa knows that living entities do not understand the extent of\nHis opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of\nHis different energies. The word prädhänyataù (“principal”) is very important\nbecause we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme\nLord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all.\nAnd vibhüti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls\nthe whole manifestation. In the Amara-koça dictionary it is stated that vibhüti\nindicates an exceptional opulence.\nThe impersonalist or pantheist cannot understand the exceptional\nopulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energies.\nBoth in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are\ndistributed in every variety of manifestation. Now Kåñëa is describing what\ncan be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated\nenergy is described in this way."

Thus this address by Kåñëa to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is\nabove such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various\nopulences.\nKåñëa first informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic\nmanifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation,\nthe Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the puruña incarnations,\nand from Him everything begins. Therefore He is ätmä, the soul of the\nmahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause.\nof the creation; actually the Mahä-Viñëu enters into the mahat-tattva, the total\nmaterial energy. He is the soul. When Mahä-Viñëu enters into the manifested\nuniverses, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every\nentity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists\ndue to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the\nspiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation\ncannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, enters. As stated in the\nSubala Upaniñad, prakåty-ädi-sarva-bhütäntar-yämé sarva-çeñé ca näräyaëaù:\n“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all\nmanifested universes.”\nThe three puruña-avatäras are described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

Viñëos tu tréëi rüpäëi puruñäkhyäny atho\nviduù: the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features—as\nKäraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu—in\nthis material manifestation. The Mahä-Viñëu, or Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, is\ndescribed in the Brahma-saàhitä (5.47).

As for future development, all living entities undergo six\nbasic changes. They are born, they grow, they remain for some time, they\nreproduce, they dwindle, and finally they vanish. Of these changes, the first is\ndeliverance from the womb, and that is Kåñëa. The first generation is the\nbeginning of all future activities.\nThe seven opulences listed—fame, fortune, fine speech, memory,\nintelligence, steadfastness and patience—are considered feminine. If a person.\npossesses all of them or some of them he becomes glorious. If a man is famous\nas a righteous man, that makes him glorious. Sanskrit is a perfect language and\nis therefore very glorious. If after studying one can remember a subject matter,\nhe is gifted with a good memory, or småti. And the ability not only to read\nmany books on different subject matters but to understand them and apply\nthem when necessary is intelligence (medhä), another opulence. The ability to\novercome unsteadiness is called firmness or steadfastness (dhåti). And when\none is fully qualified yet is humble and gentle, and when one is able to keep his\nbalance both in sorrow and in the ecstasy of joy, he has the opulence called\npatience (kñamä)."

Amongst the regulated\npoetry, the Gäyatré mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified brähmaëas,\nis the most prominent. The Gäyatré mantra is mentioned in the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam. Because the Gäyatré mantra is especially meant for God\nrealization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for\nspiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he\ncan enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire\nthe qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness\naccording to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gäyatré mantra.\nThe Gäyatré mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered\nto be the sound incarnation of Brahman. Brahmä is its initiator, and it is\npassed down from him in disciplic succession.\nThe month of November-December is considered the best of all months\nbecause in India grains are collected from the fields at this time and the people\nbecome very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is\nneither too hot nor too cold and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In\nspring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Kåñëa’s pastimes;\ntherefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the\nrepresentative of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa."

The Lord here tells Arjuna\nthat there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate\nopulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to\nKåñëa’s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahmä, the most gigantic entity, on\ndown to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each\nand all and is sustaining them.\nThere is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod\nwill lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But\nworship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the.\ngreatest demigods like Brahmä and Çiva represent only part of the opulence of\nthe Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater\nthan Him. He is asamaurdhva, which means that no one is superior to Him and\nthat no one is equal to Him. In the Padma Puräëa it is said that one who\nconsiders the Supreme Lord Kåñëa in the same category with demigods—be\nthey even Brahmä or Çiva—becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one\nthoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions\nof Kåñëa’s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of\nLord Çré Kåñëa and can fix his mind in the worship of Kåñëa without\ndeviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial\nrepresentation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure\ndevotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Kåñëa consciousness in full\ndevotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental\nposition. Devotional service and worship of Kåñëa are very clearly indicated in\nthis chapter in verses eight through eleven. That is the way of pure devotional\nservice. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association\nwith the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in\nthis chapter. Çréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa, a great äcärya in disciplic\nsuccession from Kåñëa, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,\nyac-chakti-leçät suryädyä\nbhavanty aty-ugra-tejasaù\nyad-aàçena dhåtaà viçvaà\nsa kåñëo daçame ’rcyate\nFrom Lord Kåñëa’s potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power, and\nby Kåñëa’s partial expansion the whole world is maintained.

Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements\nof Kåñëa, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that\nKåñëa is an ordinary person, Arjuna desires to see Him actually in His\nuniversal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He\nis apart from it. Arjuna’s addressing the Lord as puruñottama is also significant.\nSince the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within\nArjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can\nunderstand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form,\nfor Arjuna is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of Kåñëa.\nBut the Lord can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form\nto convince others. Arjuna did not have any personal desire for confirmation.\nKåñëa also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a\ncriterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose\nthemselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful;\none who claims to be Kåñëa should be prepared to show his universal form to\nconfirm his claim to the people."

He prays to Him to grant him the vision. This supreme vision can be obtained only through His grace.Yogesvara also means the Lord of Yoga. A Yogi is one who is endowed with the eight psychic powers (Siddhis). The Lord of the Yogins is Yogesvara. And? Yoga is identity of the individual soul with the Absolute.

But if one is engaged in loving\ntranscendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the\nLord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is\nnot possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee,\ndoes not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations\nas a living entity and acknowledges Kåñëa’s inestimable position. Arjuna could\nunderstand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the\nunlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to\nunderstand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word\nyogeçvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable\npower. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is.\nunlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of Kåñëa. He\ndoes not give Kåñëa orders. Kåñëa is not obliged to reveal Himself unless one\nsurrenders fully in Kåñëa consciousness and engages in devotional service.\nThus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental\nspeculations to see Kåñëa."

Yet because Arjuna wanted.\nto see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal\nform.\nDevotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with\nKåñëa are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences.\nThe playmates of Kåñëa, the friends of Kåñëa and the parents of Kåñëa never\nwant Kåñëa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that\nthey do not even know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In\ntheir loving exchange they forget that Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord.

Now these boys, who have performed many,\nmany pious activities in their past lives, are playing with that Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.” (Çrémad-Bhägavatam 10.12.11)\nThe fact is that the devotee is not concerned with seeing the viçva-rüpa, the\nuniversal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate Kåñëa’s statements\nso that in the future people could understand that Kåñëa not only theoretically\nor philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented\nHimself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the\nbeginning of the paramparä system. Those who are actually interested in\nunderstanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and who follow in\nthe footsteps of Arjuna should understand that Kåñëa not only theoretically\npresented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the\nSupreme.\nThe Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form.\nbecause He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have\nalready explained."

Arjuna could see in the body of Kåñëa many thousands\nof planets. As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and\nmany planets.

He was not, of course, afraid. He was\naffected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord.

Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living\nentities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him,\nbecause no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that Kåñëa is\ngreater than Brahmä because Brahmä is created by Him. Brahmä is born out of\nthe lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who\nis Kåñëa’s plenary expansion; therefore Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who is born of\nBrahmä, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. It is\nstated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam that the Lord is respected by Lord Çiva and\nBrahmä and similar other demigods.

But at the same time, after seeing that\nuniversal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to Kåñëa\nout of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear,\nalthough he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking Kåñëa to show\nHis Näräyaëa form, because He can assume any form. This universal form is\nmaterial and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the\nVaikuëöha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as\nNäräyaëa.

        "PurPort": "The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who\ncan have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of\ndivinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It\nis stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Viñëu are\ndemigods (viñëu-bhaktäù småtä deväù). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not\nbelieve in Viñëu, or who recognize only the impersonal part of Kåñëa as the\nSupreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry Kåñëa and\nat the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision\nwithout becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can\nalso see like Arjuna.\nThe Bhagavad-gétä gives the description of the universal form. Although\nthis description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have\nsome idea of the viçva-rüpa after this incident. Those who are actually divine\ncan see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without\nbeing a pure devotee of Kåñëa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the\ndivine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested in\nseeing the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse,\nArjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Kåñëa as Viñëu, and he.\nwas actually afraid of the universal form.\nIn this verse there are some significant words, just like\nveda-yajïädhyayanaiù, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the\nsubject matter of sacrificial regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic\nliterature, such as the four Vedas (Åg, Yajur, Säma and Atharva) and the\neighteen Puräëas, the Upaniñads and the Vedänta-sütra. One can study these\nat home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are sütras—Kalpa-sütras and\nMémäàsä-sütras—for studying the method of sacrifice. Dänaiù refers to\ncharity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in\nthe transcendental loving service of the Lord—the brähmaëas and the\nVaiñëavas. Similarly, “pious activities” refers to the agni-hotra and the\nprescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of\nsome bodily pains is called tapasya. So one can perform all these—can accept\nbodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc.—but unless he is a devotee\nlike Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are\nimpersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the\nLord, but from Bhagavad-gétä we understand that the impersonalists are not\ndevotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.\nThere are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an\nordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should\nfollow the principles of Bhagavad-gétä, otherwise there is no possibility of\nattaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-gétä is considered\nthe preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables\none to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say\nthat they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal\nform, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one\nbecomes a devotee of Kåñëa one cannot see the universal form of God. So one\nfirst of all has to become a pure devotee of Kåñëa; then he can claim that he\ncan show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of Kåñëa cannot\naccept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations."

When the sons of Dhåtaräñöra\ntried to disrobe Draupadé in the assembly of the Kurus, Bhéñma and Droëa\nwere silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. Kåñëa\nshowed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were\nalready killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna\nbecause devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible\nactions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now\nArjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and Kåñëa showed him. A devotee.\nis not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to\nreciprocate loving feelings.

Such is that marvellous vision which thou hast easily seen.",
        "PurPort": "In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord Kåñëa concluded revealing\nHis universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be\nseen by so many pious activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word\nsu-durdarçam is used, indicating that Kåñëa’s two-handed form is still more\nconfidential. One may be able to see the universal form of Kåñëa by adding a\nlittle tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study\nand philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti\none cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal\nform, the form of Kåñëa with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for\ndemigods like Brahmä and Lord Çiva. They desire to see Him, and we have\nevidence in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam that when He was supposed to be in the\nwomb of His mother, Devaké, all the demigods from heaven came to see the\nmarvel of Kåñëa, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was\nnot at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may\nderide Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to\nHim but to the impersonal “something” within Him, but these are all\nnonsensical postures. Kåñëa in His two-armed form is actually desired to be.\nseen by demigods like Brahmä and Çiva.\nIn Bhagavad-gétä (9.11) it is also confirmed, avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà\ntanum äçritaù: He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. Kåñëa’s\nbody, as confirmed by Brahma-saàhitä and confirmed by Kåñëa Himself in\nBhagavad-gétä, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body\nis never like a material body. But for some who make a study of Kåñëa by\nreading Bhagavad-gétä or similar Vedic scriptures, Kåñëa is a problem. For one\nusing a material process, Kåñëa is considered to be a great historical personality\nand very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He\nwas so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that\nthe Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His\nimpersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature.\nThis is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is\nspeculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on Kåñëa and\nconsider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme.\nThus some think that the universal form of Kåñëa which was manifested to\nArjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the\npersonal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the\nultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental\nprocess is described in Bhagavad-gétä, Chapter Four: to hear about Kåñëa from\nauthorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the\nVedic line hear about Kåñëa from authority, and by repeated hearing about\nHim, Kåñëa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, Kåñëa is covered\nby His yoga-mäyä potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and\neveryone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is\nconfirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute\nTruth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous Kåñëa\nconsciousness and by devotional service to Kåñëa, can have his spiritual eyes\nopened and can see Kåñëa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even\nfor the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand\nKåñëa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing Kåñëa in His\ntwo-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of\nKåñëa is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still.\nmore difficult to understand His personal form as Çyämasundara."

        "PurPort": "Kåñëa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional\nservice. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized\ncommentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-gétä by the speculative process,\nwill know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand.\nKåñëa or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once\nchanged Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to\nunderstand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it\nis clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of\nthese matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic\nliterature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways.\nThere are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand\nKåñëa, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative\nliterature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For\nexample, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on Janmäñöamé,\nthe day on which Kåñëa appeared, and on the two days of Ekädaçé (the\neleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon).\nAs far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the\ndevotees of Kåñëa who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the\nKåñëa philosophy, or Kåñëa consciousness, throughout the world. Kåñëa\nconsciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by\nRüpa Gosvämé as the most munificent man of charity because love of Kåñëa,\nwhich is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives\nsome amount of his money to persons involved in distributing Kåñëa\nconsciousness, that charity, given to spread Kåñëa consciousness, is the greatest\ncharity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the\ntemples in India there is always some statue, usually of Viñëu or Kåñëa), that is\na chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord,\ntemple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.23):\nyasya deve parä bhaktir\nyathä deve tathä gurau\ntasyaite kathitä hy arthäù\nprakäçante mahätmanaù\n [ÇU 6.23(881)]\nOne who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by.\nthe spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand Kåñëa\nby mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the\nguidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to\nunderstand Kåñëa. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no\nother process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in\nunderstanding Kåñëa.\nThe personal forms of Kåñëa, the two-handed form and the four-handed,\nare completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna.\nThe four-handed form of Näräyaëa and the two-handed form of Kåñëa are\neternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is\ntemporary. The very word sudurdarçam, meaning “difficult to see,” suggests\nthat no one had seen that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the\ndevotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by\nKåñëa at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents\nhimself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.\nThe word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one\nshould not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in\nVedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of Kåñëa. Only then\ncan one attempt to write commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä.\nKåñëa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of\nNäräyaëa and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that\nthe four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all\nemanations of the original two-handed Kåñëa. He is the origin of all\nemanations. Kåñëa is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the\nimpersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of Kåñëa are\nconcerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of\nKåñëa (which is known as Mahä-Viñëu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and\nfrom whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and\nentering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the\nBrahma-saàhitä (5.48),\nyasyaika-niçvasita-kälam athävalambya\njévanti loma-vila-jä jagad-aëòa-näthäù.\nviñëur mahän sa iha yasya kalä-viçeño\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\n“The Mahä-Viñëu, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from\nwhom they come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary\nexpansion of Kåñëa. Therefore I worship Govinda, Kåñëa, the cause of all\ncauses.” Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Kåñëa\nas the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge.\nHe is the source of all forms of Viñëu, He is the source of all forms of\nincarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in\nBhagavad-gétä.\nIn the Vedic literature (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.1) the following statement\nappears:\nsac-cid-änanda-rüpäya\nkåñëäyäkliñöa-käriëe\nnamo vedänta-vedyäya\ngurave buddhi-säkñiëe\n“I offer my respectful obeisances unto Kåñëa, who has a transcendental\nform of bliss, eternity and knowledge. I offer my respect to Him, because\nunderstanding Him means understanding the Vedas and He is therefore the\nsupreme spiritual master.” Then it is said, kåñëo vai paramaà daivatam: “Kåñëa\nis the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.3) Eko vaçé\nsarva-gaù kåñëa éòyaù: “That one Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and He is worshipable.” Eko ’pi san bahudhä yo ’vabhäti: “Kåñëa is\none, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.”\n(Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad 1.21)\nThe Brahma-saàhitä (5.1) says,\néçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù\nsac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù\nanädir ädir govindaù\nsarva-käraëa-käraëam\n“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kåñëa, who has a body of eternity,.\nknowledge and bliss. He has no beginning, for He is the beginning of\neverything. He is the cause of all causes.”\nElsewhere it is said, yaträvatérëaà kåñëäkhyaà paraà brahma naräkåti: “The\nSupreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is Kåñëa, and He sometimes\ndescends on this earth.” Similarly, in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam we find a\ndescription of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and in this list the name of Kåñëa also appears. But then it is said\nthat this Kåñëa is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead Himself (ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù kåñëas tu bhagavän\nsvayam).\nSimilarly, in Bhagavad-gétä the Lord says, mattaù parataraà nänyat: “There\nis nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead Kåñëa.” He also\nsays elsewhere in Bhagavad-gétä, aham ädir hi devänäm: “I am the origin of all\nthe demigods.” And after understanding Bhagavad-gétä from Kåñëa, Arjuna\nalso confirms this in the following words: paraà brahma paraà dhäma\npavitram-paramaà bhavän, “I now fully understand that You are the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of\neverything.” Therefore the universal form which Kåñëa showed to Arjuna is\nnot the original form of God. The original is the Kåñëa form. The universal\nform, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to\ndraw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God’s original\nform.\nThe universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with\nthe Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead\nexchanges transcendental love in His original form of Kåñëa. Therefore to\nArjuna, who was so intimately related with Kåñëa in friendship, this form of\nthe universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna,\nwho was a constant companion of Kåñëa’s, must have had transcendental eyes;\nhe was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal\nform. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating\nthemselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional\nservice the two-handed form of Kåñëa is the most dear."

        "PurPort": "Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of\nGodhead, on the Kåñëaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately\nconnected with the Supreme Personality, Kåñëa, must take this formula, as\nstated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the\nessence of Bhagavad-gétä. The Bhagavad-gétä is a book directed to the\nconditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of.\nlording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The\nBhagavad-gétä is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence\nand his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to\nteach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which\nclearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual\nactivity: devotional service.\nAs far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to\nKåñëa conscious activities. As stated in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (2.255),\nanäsaktasya viñayän\nyathärham upayuïjataù\nnirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe\nyuktaà vairägyam ucyate\nNo work should be done by any man except in relationship to Kåñëa. This is\ncalled kåñëa-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should\nnot be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for\nHim. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that\nactivity into Kåñëa consciousness, one has to do business for Kåñëa. If Kåñëa is\nthe proprietor of the business, then Kåñëa should enjoy the profit of the\nbusiness. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of\ndollars, and if he has to offer all this to Kåñëa, he can do it. This is work for\nKåñëa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can\nconstruct a nice temple for Kåñëa, and he can install the Deity of Kåñëa and\narrange for the Deity’s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of\ndevotional service. This is all kåñëa-karma. One should not be attached to the\nresult of his work, but the result should be offered to Kåñëa, and one should\naccept as prasädam the remnants of offerings to Kåñëa. If one constructs a very\nbig building for Kåñëa and installs the Deity of Kåñëa, one is not prohibited\nfrom living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is\nKåñëa. That is called Kåñëa consciousness. If, however, one is not able to\nconstruct a temple for Kåñëa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple\nof Kåñëa; that is also kåñëa-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who\nhas land—in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land—can.\nutilize that for Kåñëa by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow tulasé\nplants, because tulasé leaves are very important and Kåñëa has recommended\nthis in Bhagavad-gétä. Patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam. Kåñëa desires that one\noffer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water—and by such an\noffering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulasé. So one can sow\ntulasé and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in\nthe service of Kåñëa. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in\nworking for Kåñëa.\nThe word mat-paramaù refers to one who considers the association of Kåñëa\nin His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does\nnot wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or\nheavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He\nhas no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the\nspiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into\nthe glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual\nplanet, namely Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana. He has full knowledge of that\nplanet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the\nword mad-bhaktaù, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the\nnine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering,\nworshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out\nthe orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything\nto Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or\nat least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\nThe term saìga-varjitaù is very significant. One should disassociate himself\nfrom persons who are against Kåñëa. Not only are the atheistic persons against\nKåñëa, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental\nspeculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in\nBhakti-rasämåta-sindhu (1.1.11) as follows:\nanyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà\njïäna-karmädy-anävåtam\nänukülyena kåñëänuçélanaà bhaktir uttamä\n [Madhya 19.167].\nIn this verse Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé clearly states that if anyone wants to\nexecute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of\nmaterial contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who\nare addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from\nsuch unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires,\none favorably cultivates knowledge of Kåñëa, that is called pure devotional\nservice. Änukülyasya saìkalpaù prätikülyasya varjanam (Hari-bhakti-viläsa\n11.676). One should think of Kåñëa and act for Kåñëa favorably, not\nunfavorably. Kaàsa was an enemy of Kåñëa’s. From the very beginning of\nKåñëa’s birth, Kaàsa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was\nalways unsuccessful, he was always thinking of Kåñëa. Thus while working,\nwhile eating and while sleeping, he was always Kåñëa conscious in every\nrespect, but that Kåñëa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite\nof his always thinking of Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a\ndemon, and Kåñëa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by Kåñëa\nattains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The\npure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred\neven to the highest planet, Goloka Våndävana. His only objective is to serve\nKåñëa wherever he may be.\nA devotee of Kåñëa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he\nhas no enemy (nirvairaù). How is this? A devotee situated in Kåñëa\nconsciousness knows that only devotional service to Kåñëa can relieve a person\nfrom all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore\nhe wants to introduce this system, Kåñëa consciousness, into human society.\nThere are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their\nlives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord\nJesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for\nspreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand\nthat he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as\nÖhäkura Haridäsa and Prahläda Mahäräja. Why such risk? Because they\nwanted to spread Kåñëa consciousness, and it is difficult. A Kåñëa conscious\nperson knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his\neternal relationship with Kåñëa. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render.\nto human society is relieving one’s neighbor from all material problems. In\nsuch a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can\nimagine how merciful Kåñëa is to those engaged in His service, risking\neverything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the\nsupreme planet after leaving the body.\nIn summary, the universal form of Kåñëa, which is a temporary\nmanifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the\nform of Viñëu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kåñëa. Thus Kåñëa is\nthe origin of all these manifestations. It is not that Kåñëa is a manifestation of\nthe original viçva-rüpa, or Viñëu. Kåñëa is the origin of all forms. There are\nhundreds and thousands of Viñëus, but for a devotee no form of Kåñëa is\nimportant but the original form, two-handed Çyämasundara. In the\nBrahma-saàhitä it is stated that those who are attached to the Çyämasundara\nform of Kåñëa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and\ncannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport\nof this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of Kåñëa is essential and supreme.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Universal Form."

In Bhakti Yoga the devotee establishes a near and dear relationship with the Lord. He cultivates slowly and one of the five Bhavas (attitudes) according to his temperament? taste and capacity. The five attitudes are the Santa Bhava (the attitutde of peaceful adoration) Dasya Bhava (the attitude of servant towards the master) Sakhya Bhava (the attitude of a friend) Vatsalya Bhava (the attitude of a parent to the child) and Madhurya Bhava (the attitutde of the lover towards the beloved). The devotee adopts these attitudes towards the Lord. The last (Madhurya Bhava) is the culmination of devotion. It is merging or absorption in the Lord.The devotee adores the Lord. He constantly remembers Him (Smarana). He sings His Name (Kirtana). He speaks of His glories. He repeats His Name. He chants His Mantra (Japa). He prays and prostrates himself. He hears His Lilas (divine plays). He does total? ungrudging and unconditional selfsurrender? obtains His grace? hols communion wih? and eventually gets absorbed in Him.The devotee begins by worshipping the idols or the symbols of God. Then he performs internal worship of the Form. Ultimately he is led to the supreme worship of the allpervading Brahman (Para Puja).Thus As declared in the last verse of the previous chapter.Avyaktam The unmanifested? i.e.? incomprehensible to the senses? transcending all limiting adjuncts. The unmanifested Brahman is beyond all limitations. That which is visible to the senses is called Vyakta or manifest.The hearts of the devotees are wholly fixed on Thee. They worship Thee with all their heart and soul.There are others who worship the unmanifested Brahman which is beyond time? space and causation? which is attributeless? which is eternal and indefinable? which is beyond the reach of speech and mind. These are the wise sages.Of these two? the devotees and the men of knowledge -- who are the better knowers of Yoga (Cf.XI.55)",
        "PurPort": "Kåñëa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the\nuniversal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogés. Generally, the\ntranscendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist,\nand the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with\nall energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist also engages\nhimself, not directly in the service of Kåñëa but in meditation on the\nimpersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.\nWe find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the\nAbsolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all\ndesires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then.\nhe must take to devotional service.\nThose who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are\ncalled personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the\nimpersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning\nwhich position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute\nTruth, but Kåñëa indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional\nservice to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest\nmeans for association with the Godhead.\nIn the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, the Supreme Lord explained that\na living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the\nAbsolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the\nliving entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended\nthat he transfer his attention fully to the whole. Then again in the Eighth\nChapter it was said that anyone who thinks of Kåñëa at the time of quitting his\nbody is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of Kåñëa. And at\nthe end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all yogés, one who\nalways thinks of Kåñëa within himself is considered the most perfect. So in\npractically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached\nto the personal form of Kåñëa, for that is the highest spiritual realization.\nNevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of\nKåñëa. They are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of\ncommentaries to Bhagavad-gétä they want to distract other people from Kåñëa\nand transfer all devotion to the impersonal brahmajyoti. They prefer to\nmeditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the\nreach of the senses and is not manifest.\nAnd so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is\ntrying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes\nis most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is\nattached to the personal form of Kåñëa. He is not attached to the impersonal\nBrahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal\nmanifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the\nSupreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly\nconceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna.\nwants to say, “What is the use of such a waste of time?” Arjuna experienced in\nthe Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of Kåñëa is best\nbecause he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there\nwas no disturbance to his love for Kåñëa. This important question asked of\nKåñëa by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and\npersonal conceptions of the Absolute Truth."

        "PurPort": "The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,\nunmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jïäna-yogés,\nand persons who are in full Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotional service\nto the Lord, are called bhakti-yogés. Now, here the difference between\njïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of jïäna-yoga,\nalthough ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome,\nwhereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the.\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied\nsoul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult\nfor him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore,\nthe bhakti-yogé accepts the Deity of Kåñëa as worshipable because there is some\nbodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,\nworship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple\nis not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may\nbe saguëa and nirguëa—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.\nWorship of the Deity in the temple is saguëa worship, for the Lord is\nrepresented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented\nby material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material.\nThat is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\nA crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the\nstreet, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their\ndestination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation which we may\nfind somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the\nwork. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form,\nwhich is called arcä-vigraha. This arcä-vigraha is an incarnation of the\nSupreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is\nomnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arcä-vigraha He can\naccept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in\nconditioned life.\nSo for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme\nimmediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way\nto spiritual realization the path is difficult. They have to understand the\nunmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as\nthe Upaniñads, and they have to learn the language, understand the\nnonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for\na common man. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotional\nservice, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by\noffering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of\nthe Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord,\nrealizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt.\nthat the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the\nrisk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the\npersonalist, without any risk, trouble or difficulty, approaches the Supreme\nPersonality directly. A similar passage appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. It is\nstated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called bhakti), but instead\ntakes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman\nand spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome.\nTherefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path\nof self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.\nA living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into\nthe spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and\nknowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not\nrealized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned\nin the process of jïäna-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or\ndevotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a\nsource of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied\nsoul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice\nand at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and\none should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the\nnature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For\nevery individual living entity the process of Kåñëa consciousness, which entails\nfull engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore\nthis devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus the\nprocess of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which\nis beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should\nnever be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by\nLord Kåñëa."

In pure devotional.\nservice one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual\nsoul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord—and if he\ndoes not, then he will render service to mäyä.\nAs stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional\nservice. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully\non Kåñëa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kåñëa. It does not\nmatter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only\nfor Kåñëa. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not\ndesire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. His life’s mission is to please Kåñëa, and he can sacrifice everything\nfor Kåñëa’s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kurukñetra.

Such transcendental\nchanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.\nThe Supreme Lord herein promises that without delay He will deliver a\npure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who\nare advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet\nthey like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,\nbut as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord\nHimself takes him. The devotee does not need to wait to become very\nexperienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.\nIn the Varäha Puräëa this verse appears:\nnayämi paramaà sthänam\narcir-ädi-gatià vinä\ngaruòa-skandham äropya\nyatheccham aniväritaù\nThe purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice\nañöäìga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The\nresponsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here\nthat He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his\nparents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to.\nendeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the\nSupreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier\nGaruòa, and at once delivers the devotee from material existence. Although a\nman who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very\nexpert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks\nhim up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up\nthe devotee from this material existence.

        "PurPort": "It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be\ndelivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional.\nservice one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual\nsoul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord—and if he\ndoes not, then he will render service to mäyä.\nAs stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional\nservice. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully\non Kåñëa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kåñëa. It does not\nmatter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only\nfor Kåñëa. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not\ndesire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. His life’s mission is to please Kåñëa, and he can sacrifice everything\nfor Kåñëa’s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kurukñetra. The\nprocess is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at\nthe same time in chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/\nHare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental\nchanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.\nThe Supreme Lord herein promises that without delay He will deliver a\npure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who\nare advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet\nthey like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,\nbut as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord\nHimself takes him. The devotee does not need to wait to become very\nexperienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.\nIn the Varäha Puräëa this verse appears:\nnayämi paramaà sthänam\narcir-ädi-gatià vinä\ngaruòa-skandham äropya\nyatheccham aniväritaù\nThe purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice\nañöäìga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The\nresponsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here\nthat He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his\nparents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to.\nendeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the\nSupreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier\nGaruòa, and at once delivers the devotee from material existence. Although a\nman who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very\nexpert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks\nhim up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up\nthe devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy\nprocess of Kåñëa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service.\nAny intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to\nall other paths.

The constant effort to separate or detach oneself from the illusory five sheaths and identify oneself with the Atman is also Abhyasa. If you are not able to fix your mind and intellect wholly on the Lord all the time? then do it for some time at least.

Arjuna conered many people and brought immense wealth for the Rajasuya Yajna performed by Yudhishthira. For such a man of great powers and splendour? it is not difficult to coner this mind? and obtain the spiritual wealth of knowledge of the Self. This is what Lord Krishna meant when He addressed Arjuna by the name Dhananjaya.",
        "PurPort": "In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first.\napplies to one who has actually developed an attachment for Kåñëa, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for\none who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by\ntranscendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules\nand regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of\nattachment to Kåñëa.\nBhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in\nmaterial existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense\ngratification. But by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become\npurified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the\nSupreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to\nsome master, but I don’t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get\nsome money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and\npays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be\nelevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by\npractice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.\nThis love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there,\nlove of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material\nassociation. Now the heart has to be purified of the material association, and\nthat dormant, natural love for Kåñëa has to be revived. That is the whole\nprocess.\nTo practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the\nguidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should\nrise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and\nchant Hare Kåñëa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to\noffer to the Deity, take prasädam, and so on. There are various rules and\nregulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear\nBhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam from pure devotees. This practice can\nhelp anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress\ninto the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules\nand regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one\nto the stage of love of God."

How to do this work has\nalready been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One\nshould be sympathetic to the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness. There are\nmany devotees who are engaged in the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness,\nand they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative\nprinciples of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor\nrequires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a\nplace to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand,.\nso the same is required in the service of Kåñëa. The only difference is that in\nmaterialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be\nperformed for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has\nsufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating\nKåñëa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various\nfields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot\nsacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some\npercentage to propagate Kåñëa consciousness. This voluntary service to the\ncause of Kåñëa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for\nGod, whereupon one becomes perfect."

        "PurPort": "It may be that one is unable even to sympathize with the activities of Kåñëa\nconsciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because\nof some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of\nKåñëa consciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many\nother difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he\nsacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such\nprocedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of\nsacrifices and special functions of puëya, or special work in which the result of\none’s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated\nto the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even\ninterested in the activities of Kåñëa consciousness gives charity to some\nhospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of\nhis activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving\nup the fruits of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in\nthat purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Of course Kåñëa consciousness is not dependent on any other\nexperience, because Kåñëa consciousness itself can purify one’s mind, but if\nthere are impediments to accepting Kåñëa consciousness, one may try to give\nup the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service,\nnational service, sacrifice for one’s country, etc., may be accepted so that some\nday one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord.\nIn Bhagavad-gétä (18.46) we find it is stated, yataù pravåttir bhütänäm: if one\ndecides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the\nsupreme cause is Kåñëa, he will come gradually to understand that Kåñëa is the\nsupreme cause by the sacrificial method."

There are processes which make one understand that one\nhimself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable\nto engage in devotional service.

Devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness is the direct\nmethod, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one’s\nactivities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of\nmeditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the\nstage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take either the\nstep-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for\neveryone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be\nunderstood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because\nhe is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is\nfor others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of\nrenunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and\nBrahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, it is the\ndirect method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method\nand surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa."

These eight verses are called Amritashtakam.The devotee who is established in God bears illwill to none. He looks on all with love and great compassion. He regards all beings as himself. He does not hate even a single being? not even the creature which gives him intense pain. He who entertains mercy towards suffering people and tries to relieve their sufferings is a man of Karuna. He puts himself in the position of the sufferer and feels the pain himself. Mercy is a divine attribute. God is allmerciful. If you wish to hold communion with the Lord? and if you desire to attain Godhead? you must also become allmerciful.The perfect devotee offers full security of life (Abhayadana) to all beings. He is a Paramahamsa Sannyasi. The devotee only can really understand the mysterious ways of the Lord. He beholds the Lord everywhere. He sees the Lord in all creatures. That is the reason why he has eal vision. He is like the sun or the river. The sun sheds its light eally on a palace or a cottage. Anyone can drink the water of a river. A river enches the thirst of cows as well as tigers and lions. The idea of mineness and Iness never arises in the devotees mind. He has no sense of mine and thine. He is indifferent to pleasure and pain. He is not attached to pleasant objects. He does not hate the objects that give him pain. He is as forgiving as the earth. He is not affected a bit when anybody insults? abuses or beats him.",

        "PurPort": "In this chapter, from verse 2 through the end—from mayy äveçya mano ye\nmäm (“fixing the mind on Me”) through ye tu dharmämåtam idam (“this\nreligion of eternal engagement”)—the Supreme Lord has explained the\nprocesses of transcendental service for approaching Him. Such processes are\nvery dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question\nof who is better—one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or\none who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead—was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that\nthere is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the\nbest of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is\ndecided that through good association one develops attachment for pure\ndevotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from\nhim begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of.\ndevotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes\nengaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended\nin this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only\nabsolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute\nTruth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one\nsurrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not\nhave the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception\nmay be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one\nworks without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to\nunderstand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the\nassociation of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to\nengage in Kåñëa consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to\nundergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service,\nas described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, is more congenial.\nOne need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because\nby the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of Devotional Service"

If you include this verse also? the number of verses of the Bhagavad Gita will come to 701. Some commentators look upon this verse as an interpolation.We have come to the beginning of the third section of the Gita. Essentially the same knowledge is taught in this section but there are more details.This discourse on Kshetra (matter) is commenced with a view to determine the essential nature of the possessor of the two Prakritis (Natures)? the lower and the higher? described in chapter VII? verses 4 and 5.In the previous discourse a description of the devotee who is dear to the Lord is given from verse 13 to the end. Now the estion arises What sort of knowledge of Truth should he possess The answer is given in this discourse.Nature is composed of the three alities. It transforms itself into the body? senses and the sensual objects to serve the two purposes of the individual soul? viz.? Bhoga (enjoyment) and Apavarga (liberation).The Gita is divided into three sections illustrative of the three words of the Mahavakya or Great Sentence of the Sama Veda -- TatTvamAsi (That thou art). In accordance with this view the first six chapters deal with the path of action or Karma Yoga and the nature of the thou (TvamPada). The next six chapters explain the path of devotion or Bhakti Yoga and the nature of That (TatPada). The last six chapters treat of the path of knowledge or Jnana Yoga and the nature of the middle term art (AsiPada) which establishes the identity of the individual and the Supreme Soul (Jiva Brahma Aikyam).Arjuna now wishes to know in detail the difference between Prakriti and Purusha (Matter and Spirit). He desires to have a discriminative knowledge of the difference between them.",
        "PurPort": "Arjuna was inquisitive about prakåti (nature), puruña (the enjoyer), kñetra\n(the field), kñetra-jïa (its knower), and knowledge and the object of\nknowledge. When he inquired about all these, Kåñëa said that this body is\ncalled the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the\nfield. This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul. The\nconditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord it\nover material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material\nnature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is\nthe body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy\nsense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification,\nhe is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called kñetra, or\nthe field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person, who should not\nidentify himself with the body, is called kñetra-jïa, the knower of the field. It is\nnot very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its\nknower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that\nfrom childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is\nstill one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of\nthe field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned\nsoul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in\nthe beginning—dehino ’smin—that the living entity is within the body and\nthat the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to\nyouth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows\nthat the body is changing. The owner is distinctly kñetra-jïa. Sometimes we\nthink, “I am happy,” “I am a man,” “I am a woman,” “I am a dog,” “I am a cat.”\nThese are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different\nfrom the body. Although we may use many articles—our clothes, etc.—we\nknow that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand\nby a little contemplation that we are different from the body. I or you or.\nanyone else who owns the body is called kñetra-jïa, the knower of the field of\nactivities, and the body is called kñetra, the field of activities itself.\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä the knower of the body (the living\nentity) and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are\ndescribed. In the middle six chapters of the Bhagavad-gétä the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and\nthe Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described. The superior\nposition of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position\nof the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters. The living\nentities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they\nare suffering. When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the\nSupreme Lord in different capacities—as the distressed, those in want of\nmoney, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also\ndescribed. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity\ncomes into contact with material nature and how he is delivered by the\nSupreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation\nof knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained.

The individual souls (Jivatmas) are different but the Supreme Soul (Paramatma) is one. Wherever there is mind? there are lifreath? egoism and the individual consciousness or reflected intelligence side by side. He who has the sense of duality will take birth again and again. This delusion of dulaity can only be removed by knowledge of the identity of the individual soul and the Absolute. I am happy? I am miserable? I am the doer of this action? and I am the enjoyer of this experience -- these are the experiences of all human beings. Therefore the individual soul is bound to Samsara and is subject to pleasure and pain? and the individual souls are in different bodies. But? the Supreme Soul is free from pleasure and pain. It is not bound to Samsara. It is eternally free. It is one without a second.If there is only one individual soul in all bodies? all should have the same experience at the same time. If Rama suffers from abdominal colic? Krishna also should experience the pain at the same time. If John experiences joy? Jacob also should have a similar experience. If Choudhury is stung by a scorpion? Banerjee also should suffer from the pain. But this is not the case. When Rama suffers? Krishna rejoices. When John is jubilan? Jacob is depressed. When Choudhury suffers from the sting of a scorpion? Banerjee is enjoying his breakfast. Fields are different? bodies are different? minds are different and the individual souls are different from each other. But the knower in all these fields is one. Pleasure and pain are the Dharmas (functions) of the mind only. The individual soul is in essence identical with the Supreme Soul.The knower of the field or the Self is not affected by pleasure and pain? virtue and vice. He is the silent witness only. Pleasure and pain are the functions of the mind. They are ascribed to the Self through ignorance. The ignorant man regards the physical body as the Self. He is swayed by the two currents of likes and dislikes? he does virtuous and vicious actions and reaps the fruits of these actions? viz.? pleasure and pain? and takes birth again and again. But the sage who knows that the Kshetrajna or the knower of the field or the Self is distinct from the body is not swayed by likes and dislikes. He identifies himself with the pure? eternal? Absolute or the Supreme Self and is always happy and actionless? though he performs actions for the welfare of humanity.The disease of Timira (partial blindness) which causes perception of what is contrary to truth pertains to the eye but not to the man who perceives. If the disease is removed by proper treatment he perceives things in their true light. Even so ignorance? doubt? pleasure and pain? virtue and vice? likes and dislikes? false perceptions as well as their cause belong to the instrument (the mind) but not to the silent witness? the knower of the field? the Self.In the state of liberation wherein there is annihilation of the mind? there is no ignorance and the play of the two currents of likes and dislikes does not exist there. If false perception? ignorance? pleasure and pain? doubt? bondage? delusion? sorrow? etc.? were the essential properties of the Self? just as heat is the essential property of fire? they could not be got rid of at any time. But there have been sages of Selfrealisation in the past like Sankara? Dattatreya? Jada Bharata and Yajnavalkya who possessed extraordinary supersensual or intuitional knowledge? who were free from false perception? doubt? fear? delusion? sorrow? etc. They were not conscious of Samsara but they had perfect awareness of the Self. Therefore? we will have to conclude that the Self is ever free? pure? perfect? eternal and that ignorance inheres in the instrument (the mind) and not in the Self.Ignorance born of Tamas acts as a veil and prevents man from knowing his essential nature as,the ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute. It causes perception of what is ite the contrary of truth and causes doubt or nonperception of truth. As soon as knowledge of the Self dawns these three forms of ignorance vanish in toto. Therefore these three forms of ignorance are not the attributes of the Self. They belong to the mind? the organ or the instrument. Mind is only an effect or a product of ignorance.The wheel of Samsara or the worldprocess rotates on account of ignorance. It exists only for the ignorant man who perceives the world as it appears to him.There is no Samsara for a liberated sage. Any disease of the eye cannot in any way effect the sun (the dity presiding over the eye). The breaking of the pot will not in any way affect the ether or space in the pot. The water of the mirage cannot render the earth moist. Even so ignorance and its effecs cannot in the least affect the pure? subtle? attributeless? formless? limbless? partless and selfluminous Kshetrajna or the Self. Ignorance does not touch the Self. (Cf.X.20XIII.32XVIII.61)",
        "PurPort": "While discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the\nsoul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord,\nthe living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there\nare two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is\nthe plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, Kåñëa\nsays, “I am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I\nam the superknower. I am present in every body as the Paramätmä, or\nSupersoul.”\nOne who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower\nof the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gétä, can attain to\nknowledge.\nThe Lord says, “I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual\nbody.” The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in\nknowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is\npresent as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He\nknows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may\nknow everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his\npalace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one\nmay be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the\nproprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and\nthe citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the.\nsupreme proprietor of all bodies.\nThe body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Håñékeça, Which\nmeans “the controller of the senses.” He is the original controller of the senses,\njust as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the\ncitizens are secondary controllers. The Lord says, “I am also the knower.” This\nmeans that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his\nparticular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:\nkñeträëi hi çaréräëi\nbéjaà cäpi çubhäçubhe\ntäni vetti sa yogätmä\ntataù kñetra-jïa ucyate\nThis body is called the kñetra, and within it dwells the owner of the body\nand the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body.\nTherefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the\nfield of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of\nactivities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the\nbody, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the\nSupersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jïäna. That is the opinion of\nKåñëa. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is\nknowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower\nof activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of\nprakåti (nature), puruña (the enjoyer of nature) and éçvara (the knower who\ndominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse\nthe three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the\npainting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is\nnature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is\nthe supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic\nlanguage (in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 1.12), bhoktä bhogyaà preritäraà ca\nmatvä/ sarvaà proktaà tri vidham-brahmam etat. There are three Brahman\nconceptions: prakåti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the jéva\n(individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and\nthe controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller..\nIn this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is\nfallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate.\nOne who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same\ncontradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly,\n“I am also the knower of the field of activity.” One who misunderstands a rope\nto be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and\nthere are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his\nindividual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different\nbodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca\nis significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of\nÇréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa. Kåñëa is the Supersoul present in each and every\nbody apart from the individual soul. And Kåñëa explicitly says here that the\nSupersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer."

O Arjuna? what the field is? why the body is called the field? what are its modifications or changes in other words what transformations it undergoes? what are its properties? what effects arise in it from what causes? to whom it belongs? whether it is cultivated or whether it grows wild.That field refers to the field mentioned in verse 1.Who He is Who is that knower of the field What are His powers (Prabhavas are powers such as the power of seeing? hearing? etc.) which originate from the limiting adjuncts (such as the eys? the ears? etc.) Do thou hear My speech which describes succinctly the real nature of the field and the knower of the field in all these specific aspects.O Arjuna? I am ite sure that thou wilt clearly comprehend the truth on hearing My speech.The body is the field. The ten senses represent the ten bulls. The bulls work unceasingly day and night through the field of the objects of the senses. The mind is the supervisor. The individual soul is the tenant. The five vital airs (Pranas) are the five labourers. The Primordial Nature is the mistress of the field. This field is Her property. She Herself watches over the field vigilantly. She is endowed with the three alities. Rajas sows the seed Sattva guards it Tamas reaps the harvest. On the threshing floor or MahatTattva (the cosmic mind) with the help of the ox called time? She -- Primordial Nature -- thrashes out the corn. If the individual soul does evil actions? it sows the seeds of sin? manures with evil? reaps a crop of sin? and undergoes the pains of Samsara? viz.? birth? decay? old age? sickness? and the three kinds of afflictions. If it does virtuous actions it sows the good seeds of virtue and reaps a crop of happiness.Lord Krishna now speaks very highly in the following verse of the true nature of the field and the knower of the field in order to create interest in the hearer.",
        "PurPort": "The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of\nactivities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is\nconstituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this\nbody is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are\ncoming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of\nthe individual soul is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One\nshould also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the\nSupersoul, their different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to\nunderstand this Bhagavad-gétä directly from the description given by the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should\nbe careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body\nto be one with the individual soul, the jéva. This is something like equating the\npotent and the impotent."

Kåñëa is\nexplaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality\nof the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Vedänta, which is\naccepted as authority. First He says, “This is according to different sages.” As\nfar as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyäsadeva (the author of the\nVedänta-sütra) is a great sage, and in the Vedänta-sütra duality is perfectly\nexplained. And Vyäsadeva’s father, Paräçara, is also a great sage, and he writes\nin his books of religiosity, aham tvaà ca tathänye. .. “we—you, I and the various\nother living entities—are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now\nwe are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to\nour different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the\nlower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are\nbeing manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul,\nwhich is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is\ntranscendental.” Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the\nsoul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaöha Upaniñad.\nThere are many great sages who have explained this, and Paräçara is\nconsidered principal among them.\nThe word chandobhiù refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittiréya\nUpaniñad, for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda, describes nature,.\nthe living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nAs stated before, kñetra is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of\nkñetra-jïa: the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated\nin the Taittiréya Upaniñad (2.9), brahma pucchaà pratiñöhä. There is a\nmanifestation of the Supreme Lord’s energy known as anna-maya, dependence\nupon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme.\nThen, in präëa-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one\ncan realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In\njïäna-maya, realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of\nthinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called\nvijïäna-maya, in which the living entity’s mind and life symptoms are\ndistinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is\nänanda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of\nBrahman realization, which are called brahma puccham. Out of these, the first\nthree—anna-maya, präëa-maya and jïäna-maya—involve the fields of\nactivities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is\nthe Supreme Lord, who is called änanda-maya. The Vedänta-sütra also\ndescribes the Supreme by saying, änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät: the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental\nbliss, He expands into vijïäna-maya, präëa-maya, jïäna-maya and anna-maya.\nIn the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and\ndifferent from him is the änanda-maya. That means that if the living entity\ndecides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the änanda-maya, then he\nbecomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme\nknower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the\nnature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the\nVedänta-sütra, or Brahma-sütra.\nIt is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-sütra are very nicely\narranged according to cause and effect. Some of the sütras, or aphorisms, are\nna viyad açruteù (2.3.2), nätmä çruteù (2.3.18), and parät tu tac-chruteù\n(2.3.40). The first aphorism indicates the field of activities, the second\nindicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the\nsummum bonum among all the manifestations of various entities."

The twentyfour principles of the Sankhya school of philosophy are mentioned here.Great elements Earth? water? fire? air and ether are so called because they pervade all modifications of matter.

This is the eleventh sense whose function is thinking and doubting (Sankalpa and Vikalpa).The five objects of the senses are sound? touch? form (colour)? taste and smell. These are the fivefol pastures of the senses.All the great elements? egoism? intellect? the senses and mind are all absorbed in the Unmanifested at the time of the cosmic dissolution.Mind is Maya. Mind is Avidya (ignorance). Mind is at the root of all activities. It gives strength to desires? fosters fear and builds castles in the air. It confers force on egoism and stimultates,aspirations. Every tendency has its origin in the mind. It augments passions? gives strength to hope and awakens the sense of duality. It increases ignorance and plunges the senses in the ocean of senseobjects. It creates distinctions and differences. It separates? divides and limits. It is a strong wall or an iron barrier that stands between the individual soul and the Absolute. It is this mind that has brought Brahman to the condition of the individual soul. It is the storehouse of error? cravings? doubt? delusion and ignorance.

All these are mental states and treated as properties of the body by the Sankhya school of thought. According to the NyayaYaiseshika schools? these are the inherent alities of the Self. The modifications have a beginning and an end. Only that which is unchanging can be the witness of these modifications. The knower of the field is unchanging. He is the witness of the field and its modifications.Desire is a modification of the mind. It is an earnest longing for an object. It is a Vritti (thoughtwave) born of Rajas which urges a man who has once experienced a certain object of pleasure to get hold of it as conducive to his pleasure when he beholds the same object again. This is the property of the inner sense. It is the field because it is knowable.You enjoy a certain sensual object. The impression of this is produced in the subconscious mind. This impression is vivified or revived through memory or remembrance of the sensual pleasure. Then desire arises to enjoy the object again. Repetition of the sensual enjoyment intensifies the memory and desire. Renunciation of the objects and meditation thin out the impressions and the desires.If anyone gives a description of the beautiful scenery of Badri Narayana or Mount Kailasa at once a desire arises in our minds to vist those places. If a man says that very good sweetmeats and mangoes are available in Bangalore? a desire to get these objects crops up in your mind. Therefore memory of sensual enjoyments and the hearing of the alities of the sensual objects are the root causes of desires. Hope fattens the desires. Hope gives a new lease of life to desires. Desire excites the mind and the senses. Desire makes the mind restless. Desire makes the mind wander in the sensual grooves.An object which is sweet and pleasant to you at one moment produces the very reverse of that sensation at another moment. Everyone of you might have had this experience. Objects are pleasant only when there is a longing for them. But they are unpleasant when there is no longing for them. Therefore desires are the cause of pleasure. If satisfaction arises through enjoyment of the objects? pleasure will cease. If your mind is destitute of desires then you will always enjoy serenity? eanimity? balance or poise in spite of many obstalces or adversities. The foundation of desire is the love of sensual pleasures. Desires run along the path of your inclination? proclivity or tendency or taste. Desire is the fuel. Thought is the fire. If you withdraw the fuel of desire? the fire of thought will be extinguished like an oilless lamp. The intellect becomes impure by association with desires.Hatred is a modification of the mind. It is a negative one. It is a Vritti that impels a man who,experienced pain from a certain object to dislike it when he beholds the same object again. Hatred also is field because it is knowable. The modification that arises in the mind when your desire is not fulfilled is called hatred.Pleasure is agreeable? peaceful? made of Sattva. This is also the field because it is knowable.Pain is disagreeable or unpleasant. It is also the field because it is knowable.Sanghata Aggregate? the combination of the body and the senses or the bundle of the 35 components of the body.Chetana Intelligence is a mental state which manifests itself in the aggregate just as fire manifests itself in a ball of iron. This is also the field because it is knowable. Chetana means consciousness and also the activity of the vital airs.Dhriti Firmness? courage? fortitude. It is a Sattvic modification of the mind. The body? the senses and the mind are sustained by firmness when they are depressed and agitated. The five elements are antagonistic to each other. Water destroys earth. Fire dries up water. Water puts out fire. Wind puts out a lamp (fire). Ether absorbs the wind. The five elements fight amongst themselves and yet they (that have a natural dislike for one another) dwell together ite amicably in the same body. Each element beautifully cooperates with the others in carrying on the common functions of the body harmoniously. Each element nourishes the other elements also with its own alities. Dhriti is firmness or the power by which these fighting elements are held in union and harmony and kept in a state of steadiness and balance. This is also the field because it is knowable.Desire and the other alities that are spoken of in this verse stand for all the alities of the mind. The field that is mentioned in the first verse has been dealth with in all its different forms in the fifth and the sixth verses.",

These are the attributes of the man whose mind is turned towards the inner wisdom. If these characteristics are seen in a man in their entirety? you can infer that the knowledge of the Self has dawned in him.Humility It is the negation of vanity. It is absence of selfesteem or selfpraise. The basis of pride is the consciousness of possessing something (wealth? knowledge? strength? beauty and virtuous alities) in a larger measure than others. A proud man possesses at least something but a man of vanity possesses nothing and yet he thinks he is superior to others. Vanity is exaggerated pride. A humble man dislikes respect? honour and praise. He shuns fame and distinction. He never shows his knowledge? ability? prowess? etc. He never praises himself.Absence of hypocrisy Hypocrisy is the desire to appear what one is not. A Sannyasi has some virtues and a little theoretical knowledge derived from books. He pretends to be a liberated sage. This is religious hypocrisy. A man in whom this is absent is simple and modest. He never advertises his own virtuous alities in order to get respect? name and worship from others. He will never disclose any meritorious or charitable act done by him. He is free from pedantry. He will never sell his knowledge in order to achieve fame.Ahimsa Noninjuring of any living being in thought? word and deed. He who practises Ahimsa places his feet very carefully on the ground and avoids stepping on any living creature. If he perceives any living creature in front of him he stops and turns to the other side. His heart is full of compassion.Kshanti Forbearance? patience? forgiveness. This is a true symptom of knowledge. The man of wisdom puts up with everything. He is not affected a bit when others injure him. He never retaliates. He bears insult and injury calmly.Arjavam Straightforwardness. The man of wisdom is upright or straightforward. He is free from cunningness or diplomacy? doubledealing or crookedness. He is ite frank? candid or openhearted. He does not hide anything. His thoughts and words agree. He speaks his mind openly to the people. He is as simple as a child in his speech. He has a heart as pure as a crystal. He never cheats others.Service of the teacher Devotion to the preceptor? worship of the Guru doing acts of service to him who teaches BrahmaVidya or the means of attaining liberation. Acharya is the Master in whom the divine wisdom is embodied. Service of the Guru enables the aspirant to attain Selfrealisation. The aspirant adores his Guru as Brahman? God Himself. He worships him as Lord Vishnu. He superimposes on him all the attributes of Brahman or Lord Vishnu. He realises Brahman in and through his Guru. This is the fruit of devotion to the Guru. For a student of Vedanta devotion to the Guru is absolutely necessary. Even for a correct understanding of the scriptures the guidance of a Guru is necessary.Purity is of two kinds? external and internal purity. External purity is cleansing of the physical body with earth and water. Internal purity is cleansing of the mind of the dirt of attachment? hatred and other passions? by the method of Pratipaksha Bhavana? i.e.? by cultivating the opposite positive virtues? and by the recognition of the evil in all objects of the senses.Steadfastness The aspirant never leaves his efforts on the path of salvation even though he comes across many stumbling blocks on the path. This is steadfastness or firmness. No meditation on Brahman is possible with a fickle mind.Selfcontrol is control of the aggregate of the body and the senses. The senses and the body which naturally run externally towards the sensual objects are checked and directed on to the path of salvation. No meditation is possible in a body wherein the senses are out of control and distract attention.",
        "PurPort": "This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent\nmen as being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real\nprocess of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of\napproaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the\ntwenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out\nof the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the\nbody, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of\nknowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the\ndescriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described\nin the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi cänanya-yogena bhaktir\navyabhicäriëé: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional\nservice to the Lord. So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the\ntranscendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no\nparticular value. But if one takes to devotional service in full Kåñëa\nconsciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. As\nstated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.18.12), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä\nsarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù. All the good qualities of knowledge develop\nin one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle of.\naccepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essential.\nEven for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\nTranscendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, clearly states here that this\nprocess of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is\nnonsense.\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows.\nHumility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of\nbeing honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager\nto receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect\nknowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or\ndishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after\nthis material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion,\nand consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the\nprinciples of religion one enters into some group which is not actually\nfollowing religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious\nmentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test\nto see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body,\nbut actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in\ngeneral are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they\nperpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real\nknowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this\nmaterial entanglement. That is nonviolence.\nTolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor\nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected\nbecause material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only\nfive years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was\nendangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father\ntried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be\nmany impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we.\nshould be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\nSimplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward\nthat he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the\nspiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona\nfide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should\napproach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\nwithout the disciple’s following the regulative principles. Or, the regulative\nprinciples will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without\nreservation.\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are\ntwo kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means\ntaking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kåñëa always and\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of\npast karma from the mind.\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\nAnd self-control means that one should not accept anything which is\ndetrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed\nto this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This\nis real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to\nhave sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not\nnecessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one\ncan discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and\nuncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is\nevery possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and\nchanting Hare Kåñëa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be\nallowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kåñëa. That will control the.\neyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the\nnose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä is simply expounding the\nscience of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä try to divert the\nmind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in\nBhagavad-gétä than devotional service.\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that\nhe is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False\nego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (Båhad-äraëyaka\nUpaniñad 1.4.10) it is said, ahaà brahmäsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I\nam,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This\nsense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body\nit is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\nThere are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot\ngive up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up\nthe false identification with the body.\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age\nand disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of\nthe mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be\nthoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much\ndistress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any\nsolution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death\nthere are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be\ndiseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\nUnless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the\ndistresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our\nmaking advancement in spiritual life.\nAs for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one\nshould have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection. But.\nwhen they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be\nattached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kåñëa\nconsciousness. If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very\nhappy, because this process of Kåñëa consciousness is very easy. One need only\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to\nKåñëa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gétä and\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things\nwill make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way.\nThe family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together\nHare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,\nRäma Räma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop\nKåñëa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to\nchange from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not\nfavorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\nOne must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did.\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that\nthese family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted\nthe instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\nHappiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should\nlearn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gétä. One can never restrict the\ncoming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from\nthe materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.\nGenerally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we\nget something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the\nspiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have\nto practice unbreakable devotional service. Devotional service to Kåñëa\nwithout deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional\nservice—chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc.—as described in\nthe last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.\nNaturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want.\nto mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test\nhimself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without\nunwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary\nsporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he\nunderstands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research\nscholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but\naccording to Bhagavad-gétä such research work and philosophical speculation\nhave no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä,\none should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the\nsoul. One should make research to understand the self. That is recommended\nhere.\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\nbhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\nbhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. So\nbhakti, or devotional service, is eternal. One should be established in that\nphilosophical conviction.\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute\nTruth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman,\nParamätmä and Bhagavän.” Bhagavän is the last word in the realization of the\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of\nunderstanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the\ndevotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge.\nBeginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the\nSupreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a\nstaircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor. Now\non this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the\nsecond or the third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is\nthe understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone\nwants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in.\nspiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without\nhumility, understanding is not truly possible. To think oneself God is most\npuffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent\nlaws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. The\nbeginning of knowledge, therefore, is amänitva, humility. One should be\nhumble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion\nagainst the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One\nmust know and be convinced of this truth."

These are the evils of birth. The man of wisdom never forgets the troubles of birth? death? old age? etc. He wants to avoid being born.

        "PurPort": "This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent\nmen as being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real\nprocess of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of\napproaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the\ntwenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out\nof the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the\nbody, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of\nknowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the\ndescriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described\nin the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi cänanya-yogena bhaktir\navyabhicäriëé: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional\nservice to the Lord. So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the\ntranscendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no\nparticular value. But if one takes to devotional service in full Kåñëa\nconsciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. As\nstated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.18.12), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä\nsarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù. All the good qualities of knowledge develop\nin one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle of.\naccepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essential.\nEven for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\nTranscendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, clearly states here that this\nprocess of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is\nnonsense.\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows.\nHumility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of\nbeing honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager\nto receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect\nknowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or\ndishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after\nthis material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion,\nand consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the\nprinciples of religion one enters into some group which is not actually\nfollowing religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious\nmentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test\nto see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body,\nbut actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in\ngeneral are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they\nperpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real\nknowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this\nmaterial entanglement. That is nonviolence.\nTolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor\nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected\nbecause material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only\nfive years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was\nendangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father\ntried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be\nmany impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we.\nshould be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\nSimplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward\nthat he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the\nspiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona\nfide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should\napproach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\nwithout the disciple’s following the regulative principles. Or, the regulative\nprinciples will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without\nreservation.\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are\ntwo kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means\ntaking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kåñëa always and\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of\npast karma from the mind.\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\nAnd self-control means that one should not accept anything which is\ndetrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed\nto this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This\nis real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to\nhave sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not\nnecessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one\ncan discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and\nuncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is\nevery possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and\nchanting Hare Kåñëa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be\nallowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kåñëa. That will control the.\neyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the\nnose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä is simply expounding the\nscience of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä try to divert the\nmind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in\nBhagavad-gétä than devotional service.\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that\nhe is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False\nego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (Båhad-äraëyaka\nUpaniñad 1.4.10) it is said, ahaà brahmäsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I\nam,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This\nsense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body\nit is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\nThere are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot\ngive up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up\nthe false identification with the body.\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age\nand disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of\nthe mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be\nthoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much\ndistress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any\nsolution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death\nthere are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be\ndiseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\nUnless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the\ndistresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our\nmaking advancement in spiritual life.\nAs for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one\nshould have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection. But.\nwhen they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be\nattached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kåñëa\nconsciousness. If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very\nhappy, because this process of Kåñëa consciousness is very easy. One need only\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to\nKåñëa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gétä and\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things\nwill make one happy.

If one can mold his family life in this way to develop\nKåñëa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to\nchange from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not\nfavorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\nOne must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did.\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that\nthese family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted\nthe instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\nHappiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should\nlearn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gétä.

But if we are actually in the\nspiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have\nto practice unbreakable devotional service. Devotional service to Kåñëa\nwithout deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional\nservice—chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc.—as described in\nthe last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.\nNaturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want.\nto mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test\nhimself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without\nunwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary\nsporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he\nunderstands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research\nscholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but\naccording to Bhagavad-gétä such research work and philosophical speculation\nhave no value.

When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\nThere are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot\ngive up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up\nthe false identification with the body.\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age\nand disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of\nthe mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be\nthoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much\ndistress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any\nsolution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death\nthere are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be\ndiseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\nUnless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the\ndistresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our\nmaking advancement in spiritual life.\nAs for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one\nshould have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection. But.\nwhen they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be\nattached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kåñëa\nconsciousness. If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very\nhappy, because this process of Kåñëa consciousness is very easy. One need only\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to\nKåñëa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gétä and\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things\nwill make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way.\nThe family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together\nHare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,\nRäma Räma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop\nKåñëa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to\nchange from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not\nfavorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\nOne must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did.\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that\nthese family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted\nthe instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\nHappiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should\nlearn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gétä. One can never restrict the\ncoming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from\nthe materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.\nGenerally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we\nget something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the\nspiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have\nto practice unbreakable devotional service. Devotional service to Kåñëa\nwithout deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional\nservice—chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc.—as described in\nthe last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.\nNaturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want.\nto mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test\nhimself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without\nunwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary\nsporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he\nunderstands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research\nscholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but\naccording to Bhagavad-gétä such research work and philosophical speculation\nhave no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä,\none should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the\nsoul. One should make research to understand the self. That is recommended\nhere.\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\nbhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\nbhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. So\nbhakti, or devotional service, is eternal. One should be established in that\nphilosophical conviction.\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute\nTruth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman,\nParamätmä and Bhagavän.” Bhagavän is the last word in the realization of the\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of\nunderstanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the\ndevotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge.\nBeginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the\nSupreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a\nstaircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor. Now\non this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the\nsecond or the third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is\nthe understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone\nwants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in.\nspiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without\nhumility, understanding is not truly possible. To think oneself God is most\npuffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent\nlaws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. The\nbeginning of knowledge, therefore, is amänitva, humility. One should be\nhumble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion\nagainst the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One\nmust know and be convinced of this truth."

Of all the\ndescriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described\nin the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi cänanya-yogena bhaktir\navyabhicäriëé: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional\nservice to the Lord. So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the\ntranscendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no\nparticular value. But if one takes to devotional service in full Kåñëa\nconsciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. As\nstated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam (5.18.12), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä\nsarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù. All the good qualities of knowledge develop\nin one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle of.\naccepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essential.\nEven for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\nTranscendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, clearly states here that this\nprocess of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is\nnonsense.\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows.\nHumility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of\nbeing honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager\nto receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect\nknowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or\ndishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after\nthis material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion,\nand consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the\nprinciples of religion one enters into some group which is not actually\nfollowing religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious\nmentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test\nto see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body,\nbut actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in\ngeneral are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they\nperpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real\nknowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this\nmaterial entanglement. That is nonviolence.\nTolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor\nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected\nbecause material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only\nfive years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was\nendangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father\ntried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be\nmany impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we.\nshould be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\nSimplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward\nthat he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the\nspiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona\nfide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should\napproach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\nwithout the disciple’s following the regulative principles. Or, the regulative\nprinciples will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without\nreservation.\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are\ntwo kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means\ntaking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kåñëa always and\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of\npast karma from the mind.\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\nAnd self-control means that one should not accept anything which is\ndetrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed\nto this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This\nis real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to\nhave sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not\nnecessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one\ncan discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and\nuncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is\nevery possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and\nchanting Hare Kåñëa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be\nallowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kåñëa. That will control the.\neyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the\nnose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä is simply expounding the\nscience of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä try to divert the\nmind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in\nBhagavad-gétä than devotional service.\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that\nhe is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False\nego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (Båhad-äraëyaka\nUpaniñad 1.4.10) it is said, ahaà brahmäsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I\nam,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This\nsense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body\nit is false ego.

Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and\nchanting Hare Kåñëa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be\nallowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kåñëa. That will control the.\neyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the\nnose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä is simply expounding the\nscience of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä try to divert the\nmind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in\nBhagavad-gétä than devotional service.\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that\nhe is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False\nego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (Båhad-äraëyaka\nUpaniñad 1.4.10) it is said, ahaà brahmäsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I\nam,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This\nsense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body\nit is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\nThere are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot\ngive up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up\nthe false identification with the body.\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age\nand disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of\nthe mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be\nthoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much\ndistress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any\nsolution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death\nthere are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be\ndiseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\nUnless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the\ndistresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our\nmaking advancement in spiritual life.\nAs for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one\nshould have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection. But.\nwhen they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be\nattached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kåñëa\nconsciousness. If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very\nhappy, because this process of Kåñëa consciousness is very easy. One need only\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to\nKåñëa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gétä and\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things\nwill make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way.\nThe family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together\nHare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,\nRäma Räma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop\nKåñëa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to\nchange from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not\nfavorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\nOne must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did.\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that\nthese family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted\nthe instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\nHappiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should\nlearn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gétä. One can never restrict the\ncoming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from\nthe materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.\nGenerally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we\nget something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the\nspiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have\nto practice unbreakable devotional service. Devotional service to Kåñëa\nwithout deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional\nservice—chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc.—as described in\nthe last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.\nNaturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want.\nto mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test\nhimself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without\nunwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary\nsporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he\nunderstands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research\nscholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but\naccording to Bhagavad-gétä such research work and philosophical speculation\nhave no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä,\none should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the\nsoul. One should make research to understand the self. That is recommended\nhere.\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\nbhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\nbhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. So\nbhakti, or devotional service, is eternal. One should be established in that\nphilosophical conviction.\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam (1.2.11) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute\nTruth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman,\nParamätmä and Bhagavän.” Bhagavän is the last word in the realization of the\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of\nunderstanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the\ndevotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge.\nBeginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the\nSupreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a\nstaircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor. Now\non this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the\nsecond or the third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is\nthe understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone\nwants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in.\nspiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without\nhumility, understanding is not truly possible. To think oneself God is most\npuffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent\nlaws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. The\nbeginning of knowledge, therefore, is amänitva, humility. One should be\nhumble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion\nagainst the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One\nmust know and be convinced of this truth."

It has no ality like whiteness? blackness? etc. It has no relation or connection with anything else? because It is one without a second. It is no object of any sense. It is beyond the reach of the mind and the senses. It is actionless. It is the great transcendental and unmanifested Absolute. It is always the witnessing subject in all objects.The Vedas emphatically declare that Brahman is without attributes? activity? attachment or parts.In chapter IX. 19 it was stated that He is the being and also the nonbeing. It is now stated that He is neither being nor nonbeing. This would seem to the readers to be a contradiction in terms but it is not so. Though the manifest (perishable) and the unmanifest (imperishable) universe are both forms of Brahman? He is beyond both these. (Cf.VII.2XV.16?17and18)",
        "PurPort": "The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field.\nHe has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of\nactivities. Now He begins to explain the knowable, first the soul and then the\nSupersoul. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one\ncan relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living\nentity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which\nthe jéva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the jévätmä’s\nmanifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The\nVedic literature confirms this: na jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcit (Kaöha Upaniñad\n1.2.18). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of\nknowledge.\nThe Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 6.16) to be pradhäna-kñetrajïa-patir guëeçaù, the chief\nknower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature. In\nthe småti it is said, däsa-bhüto harer eva nänyasvaiva kadäcana. The living\nentities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also\nconfirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings. Therefore the description of\nBrahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and\nwhen the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood\nthat he is vijïäna-brahma as opposed to änanda-brahma. Änanda-brahma is the\nSupreme Brahman Personality of Godhead."

Hence they put on the semblance of consciousness? just as the iron piece puts on the semblance of a magnet when it is in the presence of a magnet.The whole world is superimposed on Brahman like the snake on the rope.

There are unlimited heads, legs,\nhands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the\nSupersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul,\nhowever, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is\nnot possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his\nhands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge\nhe will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the\nindividual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme.\nThe Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can\nextend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-gétä\nthe Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He\naccepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is\nthe omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode,\nfar, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone\noffers. That is His potency.

        "PurPort": "The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living\nentities, doesn’t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual\nsouls have spiritual senses, but in conditioned life they are covered with the.\nmaterial elements, and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through\nmatter. The Supreme Lord’s senses are not so covered. His senses are\ntranscendental and are therefore called nirguëa. Guëa means the material\nmodes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood\nthat His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our\nsensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are\nuncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad\n(3.19) in the verse apäëi-pädo javano grahétä. The Supreme Personality of\nGodhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His\nhands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction\nbetween the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but\nHe has eyes—otherwise how could He see? He sees everything—past, present\nand future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what\nwe have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in\nthe future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä: He knows everything, but\nno one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He\ncan travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the\nLord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and\nbecause we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things.\nBut His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.\nBhagavad-gétä also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is\nby His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy,\nbecause He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that\nHis whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form, called\nsac-cid-änanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor\nof all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full\nof knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all\nactivity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord\nis always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs,\nHe has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can\nsee the Lord’s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His\nform. Therefore the impersonalists, who are still materially affected, cannot.\nunderstand the Personality of Godhead."

And the\nSupreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours\neverything at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh\nChapter when the Lord said that He had come to devour all the warriors\nassembled at Kurukñetra. He also mentioned that in the form of time He\ndevours also. He is the annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He\ndevelops all from their original state, and at the time of annihilation He\ndevours them. The Vedic hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all\nliving entities and the rest of all. After creation, everything rests in His\nomnipotence, and after annihilation everything again returns to rest in Him.\nThese are the confirmations of Vedic hymns.

It is selfluminous? The sun does not shine there? nor do the moon and the stars? nor do these lightnings shine and much less this fire. When It shines? everything shines after It all these shine by Its Light. (Kathopanishad 5.15 also Svetasvataropanishad 6.14)Knowledge Such as humility. (Cf.XIII.7to11)The knowable As described in verses 12 to 7.The goal of knowledge? i.e.? capable of being understood by wisdom.These three are installed in the heart (Buddhi) of every living being.

Even so? though Brahman is present in all objects? the intellect shines with special effulgence received from Brahman. (Cf.X.20XIII.3XVIII.61)",
        "PurPort": "The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light\nin all luminous objects like the sun, moon and stars. In the Vedic literature we\nfind that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon, because the\neffulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that\nbrahmajyoti, the Lord’s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the\nmaterial elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of\nsun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need\nof such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His\nluminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His\nsituation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world,\nwhich is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic\nliterature. Äditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad 3.8). He is\njust like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of\nthis material world.\nHis knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that\nBrahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to\nbe transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord,\nwho is situated in everyone’s heart. One Vedic mantra (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad\n6.18) says, taà ha devam ätma-buddhi-prakäçaà mumukñur vai çaraëam ahaà\nprapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he\nat all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned, it\nis also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditväti måtyum eti. “Only by.\nknowing Him can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.” (Çvetäçvatara\nUpaniñad 3.8)\nHe is situated in everyone’s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme\nhas legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the\nindividual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of\nactivity—the individual soul and the Supersoul—must be admitted. One’s\nhands and legs are distributed locally, but Kåñëa’s hands and legs are\ndistributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad (3.17):\nsarvasya prabhum éçänaà sarvasya çaraëaà båhat. That Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu, or master, of all living entities; therefore\nHe is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact\nthat the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different"

        "PurPort": "The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable.\nThis knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of\nknowing. Combined, these are called vijïäna, or the science of knowledge.\nPerfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord\ndirectly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate\nstage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this.\nKnowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in\nKåñëa consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon\nas we transfer all consciousness to Kåñëa’s activities and realize that Kåñëa is\neverything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is\nnothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service\nperfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained.\nNow, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7, beginning\nfrom mahä-bhütäni and continuing through cetanä dhåtiù, analyze the material\nelements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to\nform the body, or the field of activities. And verses 8 through 12, from\namänitvam through tattva-jïänärtha-darçanam, describe the process of\nknowledge for understanding both types of knower of the field of activities,\nnamely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18, beginning from\nanädi mat-param and continuing through hådi sarvasya viñöhitam, describe the\nsoul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul.\nThus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the\nprocess of understanding, and both the soul and the Supersoul. It is especially\ndescribed here that only the unalloyed devotees of the Lord can understand\nthese three items clearly. So for these devotees Bhagavad-gétä is fully useful; it\nis they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord,\nKåñëa. In other words, only devotees, and not others, can understand\nBhagavad-gétä and derive the desired result."

Even so? steps are necessary to reach the summit of the knowledge of the Self. That is the reason why Lord Krishna took Arjuna to the summit of knowledge step by step. He first taught Arjuna the nature of the field? then knowledge? ignorance or nonwisdom? and ultimately the knowable. When a child is to be fed,the intelligent mother divides the food into small portions and feeds the child little by little. Even so Lord Krishna fed His spiritual child Arjuna with the spiritual food little by little.Lord Krishna says O Arjuna I will give you the same teaching in another form by the description of the Spirit and Nature.Till now the Lord expounded the knowledge of the field and the Self in accordance with the philosophy of the Upanishads. Now He explains the same knowledge in accordance with the Sankhya philosophy? but without accepting its dual nature in the form of discrimination between the Spirit and Nature.Vikaras Modifications from the MahatTattva or intellect down to the physical body the twentyfour principles of the Sankhyas. The Self within is changeless. All changes take place in Nature. Mulaprakriti (the Primordial Nature? the Unmanifested) becomes modified into Mahat? egoism? mind? the great elements and other minor modifications.Just as coolness and ice? the day and the night? are inseparable? so also matter and Spirit are inseparable. The three alities Sattva? Rajas and Tamas are born of Nature (matter). All actions proceed from the mind? the lifeforce? the senses and the physical body.According to the Sankhya philosophy? Prakriti and Purusha are not only eternal and beginningless but also independent of each other and selfcreated. According to Vedanta philosophy? Prakriti or Maya originates from Brahman and is? therefore? neither selfcreated nor independent. Isvara has Maya under His perfect control. Maya is His causal body. Maya is His illusory power.Matter and Spirit are the Natures of Isvara. Know that these two are beginningless. That which has no beginning is Anadi. As Isvara is eternal? His two Natures also should be eternal. (This is according to the Sankhyas.)Isvara possesses these two Natures (superior and inferior) by which He causes the creation? preservation and destruction of the universe. Therefore He has the Lordship and rules over the universe. The two Natures have no beginning. Therefore they are the cause of Samsara.The inferior Nature (Apara Prakriti) which consists of the eightfold division of Nature referred to in chapter VII? verse 4? is the Prakriti of chapter XIII? verse 19. The superior Nature (Para Prakriti) referred to in chapter VII? verse 5? is the Purusha of chapter XIII? verse 19. Purusha here means Jiva (the individual soul).Even a child smiles and experiences exhilaration? grief? fear? anger? pleasure and pain. Who taught it The impressions of the virtuous and vicious actions of this birth cannot be the cause of these. The impressions of the previous birth alone are the cause of all these. They (the impressions) must have a support. From this we can clearly infer the existence of the individual soul in the previous birth and that the individual soul is beginningless. If you do not accept that the individual soul is beginningless? the two defects of Kritanasa (nonfruition of actions performed) and Akritabhyagama (causeless effect) will creep in. Pleasure and pain which are the fruits of virtuous and vicious actions done previously will pass away without being experienced. This is the defect of Kritanasa. So also? one will have to enjoy pleasure and pain? the fruits of good and bad actions which were not done by him previously. This is the defect of Akritabhyagama. In order to get rid of these two defects we will have to accept that the individual soul is beginningless. The scriptures,also emphatically declare that the soul is beginningless.",
        "PurPort": "By the knowledge given in this chapter, one can understand the body (the\nfield of activities) and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and\nthe Supersoul). The body is the field of activity and is composed of material\nnature. The individual soul that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the\nbody is the puruña, or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the\nSupersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the\nindividual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of.\nGodhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul\nis in the category of His personal expansion.\nBoth material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that\nthey existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy\nof the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities\nare of the superior energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed\nbefore this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Mahä-Viñëu, and when it was required, it\nwas manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are\nalso in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are averse to serving the\nSupreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But\nwith the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a\nchance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the\nspiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the\nliving entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but\ndue to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really\ndoes not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme\nLord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of\nGodhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the\nscriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are\nundergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty\nfrom the descriptions of these few verses that all transformations and\ninfluences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of\nmaterial nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities\nare due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the\nsame"

The force of desire acts on the mind and the mind impels the senses to act to get the objects of desire. Good and evil actions proceed from Nature and lead to happiness or misery. Evil actions produce misery and sorrow. Virtuous actions cause happiness and joy. The soul is the enjoyer. The wife works and prepares nice? palatable dishes the huand silently enjoys the fruits of her labour. He sits ietly and eats them to his hearts content.

Thus Nature is the cause of Samsara.Sugarcane is the cause. Sugarcane juice? sugar and sugarcandy are the effects or modifications of sugarcane. Milk is the cause. Curd? butter and ghee (meleted butter) are the modifications of milk. Whatever is a modification of something is its effect? and that from which the modifications come is their cause. Nature is the source or cause of all modifications. She generates everything. The ten organs? mind and the five objects of the senses are the sixteen modifications or effects.Mahat (intellect) is born of Mulaprakriti. From Mahat Ahamkara (egoism) is born. Mahat is the effect of Mulaprakriti and the cause of Ahamkara. Therefore Mahat is called PrakritiVikriti. Mahat? Ahamkara and the five Tanmatras (rootelements of matter) are the seven PrakritiVikriti. Each of these is a modification of its predecessor and is in turn the cause of its successor. The five rootelements generate the five gross elements. They are the subtle elements. These seven are both Nature and modification (Prakriti and Vikriti)? cause and effect? and are included under the term cause.The functions of the body? senses? lifeforce? mind and intellect are superimposed on the pure Self. So the ignorant man says I am black I am fat I am hungry I am angry I am deaf I am blind I am the son of so and so? I know? I am the doer? I am the enjoyer? etc.The intellect is very subtle. It is in close contact with the most subtle Self. The Consciousness of the Self is reflected in the intellect (Chidabhasa) and so the intellect which has the semblance of,the Consciousness feels I am pure consciousness or Chaitanya. I experience pleasure and pain. The attributes of the pure Self are superimposed on the intellect. There is mutual superimposition between the intellect and the Self? Nature and Spirit. This is the cause of Samsara.Purusha? Jiva? Kshetrajna and Bhokta are all synonymous terms. Purusha here referred to is not the Supreme Self. He is the conditioned soul? the soul subject to transmigration who experiences pleasure and pain. The Self or the Absolute is ever free from Samsara and is unchanging.Prakriti and Purusha are the cause of Samsara. Nature generates the body? lifeforce? mind? intellect and the senses. The soul experiences pleasure and pain. Samsara is the experience of pleasure and pain. The soul is the Samsarin. He is the experiencer of pleasure and pain. (Cf.XV.9)",
        "PurPort": "The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities\nare due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and\nthese varieties are creations of the material nature. They arise from the\ndifferent sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this\nbody or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of\nhappiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,\nand not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment;\ntherefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material\nnature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such\nthing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is\nstruggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be\nmore clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are\ninstruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total—body and instrument\nsenses—are offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse,\nthe living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past\ndesire and activity. According to one’s desires and activities, material nature.\nplaces one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his\nattaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering.\nOnce placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of\nnature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At\nthat time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity\nis put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he\nmust act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put\ninto the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog.\nSimilarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act\naccording to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the\nSupersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas (Muëòaka\nUpaniñad 3.1.1) as follows: dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyaù. The Supreme Lord is so\nkind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul\nand in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul, or Paramätmä."

        "PurPort": "This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities\ntransmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter\nthat the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one\nchanges dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material\nexistence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to\ncontinue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it\nover material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the\ninfluence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,\nsometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as\na saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity\nthinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the\ninfluence of material nature.\nHow he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to\nassociation with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore,\nabove the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental\nposition. That is called Kåñëa consciousness. Unless one is situated in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one\nbody to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he\nhas to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing\nfrom authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the\nscience of God from Kåñëa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing\nprocess, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and\ngradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he\ncomes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he\nbecomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he.\nproportionately relishes his eternal blissful life"

When the priests and the sacrificer perform the sacrificial rites? an expert who has good experience in sacrifical matters sits by their side. He does not take any part at all in the sacrifice. He sits as a silent witness. He guides them. He points out their defects and corrects them. Even so the Supreme Self does not act. It does not take any part in the activities of the body? the mind and the senses. It is entirely distinct from them. It is a silent witness of their activities. It sits near Nature and silently watches Her actions.It may be explained in another way. The body? the eyes? the mind? the intellect and the Self are the,seers. Of these the body is the most external seer the Self is the most internal and nearest seer. Beyond the Self there is no other internal seer.Anumanta Permitter. The Supreme Self gives consent. It expresses Its approval or satisfaction regarding the actions done by the senses? the mind and the intellect. The King consents and says Yes. The Prime Minister and the other officers carry out his orders. Even so the Supreme Self consents or gives permission the body? the mind? the intellect? and the senses perform their respective functions. Or? though It Itself does not work while the senses? the mind and the intellect work? It appears to be engaged in action? it seems to cooperate with them. As It is an onlooker or mere witness? It never stands in the way of the activities of the body? the mind? the intellect and the senses.Bharta Supporter. Just as the huand is the supporter of his wife? so also the Self is the supporter of this body? mind? intellect? lifeforce and the senses. It is different from them? just as the father who supports the children is different from them.Bhokta Enjoyer the Self? of the nature of eternal intelligence. Just as heat is the inherent nature of fire? so also eternal intelligence is the inherent nature of the Self. All the states of the mind such as pleasure? pain and delusion are permeated and illumined by the intelligent Self. Just as Govindan who takes the food is different from the foo? so also the Self is different from the intellect? the mind and the senses.Mahesvarah The great Lord. As He is the soul or essence of everything and as He is independent of all? He is Mahesvara. The sky is very big. Mahesva is bigger than even the sky? and so He is called Mahesvara. Just as the king is different from his subjects? so also the Self is different from Nature and the effects or modifications of Nature.Paramatma The Supreme Self. It is supreme because It is superior to all those things? from the Unmanifested to the physical body? which are mistaken for the Self on account of ignorance. Just as an iron piece moves in the presence of a magnet so also the mind and the intellect which are insentient move and function in the presence of the Supreme Self. Just as the moon borrows its light from the sun? so also the mind and the intellect borrow their light from the Supreme Self. The Supreme Self is selfluminous. Mind and intellect have no selfluminosity. In the Vedas also He is called the Supreme Self. Lord Krishna says in verse 17 of the fifteenth chapter But distinct is the Highest Purusha spoken of as the Supreme Self.Do thou also know Me as the knower of the field in all the fields? has been described in detial and the subject is concluded in this verse.",
        "PurPort": "It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul,\nis the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity.\nBecause the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they\nthink that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the Paramätmä in\nevery body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para,\ntranscendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field,.\nbut the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in\nbodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.\nHis name is Paramätmä, not ätmä, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly\nclear that the ätmä and Paramätmä are different. The Supersoul, the\nParamätmä, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not.\nAnd because the Paramätmä is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to\nsanction the individual soul’s desiring material enjoyment. Without the\nsanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The\nindividual is bhukta, or the sustained, and the Lord is bhoktä, or the\nmaintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them\nas a friend.\nThe fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of\nthe Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But\nthe living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord\nand act independently in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has\nthis tendency he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living\nentity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy.\nAs long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his\nfriend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual\nenergy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but\ndue to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting\nthe association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of\nhis material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always\ngiving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives\ninstructions as stated in Bhagavad-gétä, and from within He tries to convince\nthe living entity that his activities in the material field are not conducive to\nreal happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be\nhappy,” He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the\nParamätmä or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward\na blissful eternal life of knowledge."

Such is the advantage he gains from the discriminative knowledge of Spirit and Matter. He knows that he is eternal and changeless and that all changes are due to the modifications of Nature on account of its alities. The self through ignorance identifies itself with the body and suffers rirth.In whatsoever condition he may be? whether he is engaged in prescribed or forbidden acts (like Indra who killed the Purohita Visvarupa and many Sannyasins)? he is not born again? because the,actions (which are the seeds of rirth)? of one who knows the Spirit and Matter? who has gained the knowledge of the Self? are burnt by the fire of that knowledge. Just as the seeds that are fried in fire do not sprout again? so also the actions burnt in the fire of knowledge cannot produce new bodies or further births. In his case they are Karmabhasa (mere semblance of Karma). They are not effective causes and cannot produce further births. A burnt cloth cannot serve the purpose of the cloth.Those actions which are done with egoism and desire (expectation of fruits) will produce fruits or results. In the case of a wise man? the seeds of evil? viz.? ignorance? egoism? attachment? etc.? are burnt by the fire of knowledge. Therefore he cannot have rirths.The Karmas (Prarabdha) which have already started their operation by producing this present birth do not perish? notwithstanding the dawn of the knowledge of the Self. When an arrow is once sent out from a bow at a mark? it pierces the mark and continues to act till it falls to the ground when the full force with which it was dischared is exhausted. Even so the Prarabdha Karma which has given rise to the body continues to act till the inherent force is fully exhausted? although the sage has attained Selfrealisation through his body. But he is not in the least affected by this? because he has no identification with the body? and as he has identified himelf with Brahman or the Absolute. If a carbuncle or cancer arises in the body on account of Prarabdha Karma? he will not suffer a bit as he has risen above bodyconsciousness? and as he stands as a witness of his body. But a bystander or a spectator wrongly imagines that the liberated sage is also suffering like an ordinary worldly man. This is a serious and sad mistake. From the viewpoint of the liberated sage he has neither body nor Prarabdha Karma.An arrow that is placed ready on the bow but not discharged with force can be withdrawn. Similarly? the Karmas which have not begun to generate their fruits or effects can be neutralised or destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. Therefore it is proper to say that the liberated sage is not born again. He will not take another body when the body through which he attained knowledge perishes. As ignorance? the cause of this body? is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self? birth? the effect of ignorance? is also destroyed. As one takes birth through virtuous and vicious actions? a sage will not take birth as his virtuous and visiouc actions (the whole Sanchita or accumulated Karmas of his previous births) are destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. The Karmas done by him after he has attained Selfrealisation cannot touch him at all as he has neither egoism (agency) nor desires. (Cf.XIII.32)",
        "PurPort": "Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul\nand their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the\nspiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature.\nThis is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand\ndistinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material\nexistence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly\npersons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then\nrevert to spiritual consciousness or Kåñëa consciousness by understanding\nBhagavad-gétä as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead.

The first path is the Yoga of meditation taught by Maharshi Patanjali. The Raja Yogins behold the Supreme Self in the self (Buddhi) by the self (purified mind). Meditation is a continous and unbroken flow of thought of the Self like the flow of oil from one vessel to another. Through concentration hearing and the other senses are withdrawn into the mind. The senses are not allowed to run towards their respective sensual objects. They are kept under proper check and control through the process of abstraction. Then the mind itself is made to abide in the Self through constant meditation on the Self. The mind is refined or purified by meditation. The mind that is rendered pure will naturally move towards the Self. It is not attracted by nor is it attached to the sensual objects.Sankhya Yoga is Jnana Yoga. The aspirant does Vichara (analysis? reflection) and separates himself from the three alities of Nature? the three bodies and the five sheaths and identifies himself with the witness (Self). He thinks and feels? I am distinct from the three alities. I am the silent witness. I am unattached. I am nondoer. I am nonenjoyer. I am immortal? eternal? selfexistent? selfluminous? indivisible? unborn and unchanging.The Karma Yogi surrenders his actions and their fruits to the Lord. He has Isvarapana Buddhi (intelligence that offers everything to God). This produces purity of mind which gives rise to knowledge of the Self. Karma Yoga brings about concentration of the mind through the purification of the mind. It leads to Yoga through the purification of the mind and so it is spoken of as Yoga itself.Those who practise Sankhya Yoga are the highest class of spiritual aspirants. Those who practise the Yoga of meditation are aspirants of the middling class. Those who practise Karma Yoga are the lowest class of spiritual aspirants. The aspirants of the middling and lowest class soon become aspirants of the highest class through rigorous Sadhana or spiritual practices. (Cf.V.5VI.46)",
        "PurPort": "The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned souls can be divided into\ntwo classes as far as man’s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who\nare atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual\nunderstanding. But there are others, who are faithful in their understanding of\nspiritual life, and they are called introspective devotees, philosophers, and\nworkers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish\nthe doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics. In.\nother words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are best\nsituated in spiritual understanding, because they understand that beyond this\nmaterial nature are the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, who is expanded as the Paramätmä, the Supersoul in everyone, the\nall-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the\nSupreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be\ncounted in the class of the faithful. The Säìkhya philosophers analyze this\nmaterial world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as\nthe twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the\nindividual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to\nunderstand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they\nalso come to the standard of devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness. Those\nwho work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are\ngiven a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in\nconsciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when\nthey discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally\nsituated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme\nSoul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate the\nhaöha-yoga system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nby childish activities."

Some of the\npeople may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually\nthere is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good\nsoul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process\nis very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached Kåñëa consciousness in the\nmodern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply\nhears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord\nCaitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa,\nKåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. It\nis stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from\nrealized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The\nworship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya\nhas said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should\ngive up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative\nreasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in.\nknowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a\npure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps,\none will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse\nparticularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very\nappropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called\nphilosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one\ntranscend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home."

The Supreme Self abides in all forms. There is nothing apart from It.An ignorant man destroyes the Self by identifying himself with the body and the modifications of the mind and by not seeing the one Self in all beings. He has a blurred vision. His mind is very gross. He cannot think of the subtle Self. He is swayed by the force of ignorance. He mistakes the impure body for the pure Self. He has false knowledge. But the sage has knowledge of the Self or true knowledge and so he beholds the one Self in all beings. An ignorant man is the slayer of his Self. He destroys this body and takes another body and so on. But he who beholds the one Self in all beings does not destroy the Self by the self. Therefore he attains the Supreme Goal? i.e.? he attains release from the round of birth and death. Knowledge of the Self leads to liberation or salvation. Knowledge of the Absolute annihilates the ignorance in toto. If the ignorance is destroyed and false knowledge is also destroyed? all evils are simultaneously destroyed.Those who have realised that unity of the Self in all these diverse forms are never caught in the meshes of birth and death. They attain the state of Turiya (the fourth state beyond waking? dreaming and deep sleep) where form and sound do not exist.The self is everybodys friend and also his enemy as well. The idea first expressed in chapter VI? verses 5 and 6 is repeated here. (Cf.XVIII.20)",

But if one understands that the\nSupreme is situated in His Paramätmä manifestation everywhere, that is, if one\ncan see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living\nthing, he does not degrade himself by a destructive mentality, and he therefore\ngradually advances to the spiritual world. The mind is generally addicted to\nsense gratifying processes; but when the mind turns to the Supersoul, one\nbecomes advanced in spiritual understanding"

A spiritual master, by various\ninstructions, teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life.\nFor instance, in Bhagavad-gétä we find Kåñëa instructing Arjuna to free him\nfrom materialistic considerations.\nOne can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its\ntwenty-four elements. The body is the gross manifestation. And the subtle.\nmanifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life\nare the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the soul,\nand there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This\nmaterial world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four\nmaterial elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material\nmanifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and can\nalso see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the\nspiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization,\nand one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of\nthe spiritual master.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness."

Those in ignorance of this\nthink that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in\nthe spiritual sky, one attains a spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and\nthe spiritual situation is called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be\nuncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To\nobtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who\nthus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or by\nthe destruction of the material world."

The cosmos is evolved out of His Nature. Nature is called the great Brahma for She is the resting place of the five subtle elements and also the Mahat (cosmic mind). She is callled the great Brahma? because through Her the whole manifestation takes place.All changes arise out of this great Nature. So She has got the name Mulaprakriti or Primordial Nature or the original principle. From the point of view of the Unmanifest She is called Avyakta. The Vedantins call Her Maya (illusion). The Sankhyas call Her Prakriti.This Prakriti is called great because She is greater than all Her effects. This Nature? made of the three alities? is the material cause of all beings. As She is the source or cause of all Her,modifications and also nourishes all the modifications with Her energy? She is called Brahma.I place in it (the Mahabrahma) the embryo of life then all beings begin to come to life therefrom. In the great Brahma or Nature I place the germ or the seed for the birth of Hiranyagarbha and the seed gives birth to all beings. The birth of Hiranyagarbha or Brahma (the Creator) gives rise to the birth of beings. The Primordial Nature is like the clay. She cannot create the forms Herself. She gives birth to Brahma Who creates all beings just as the potter creates various forms from the clay. I am endowed with the two Saktis? viz.? the superior and the inferior Natures (Cf. VII. 4 and 5)? the field and its knower. I unite these two (the Spirit and the matter). The individual soul comes under the influence of the limiting adjuncts? viz.? ignorance? desire and action. On account of ignorance (Avidya)? the individual soul forgets his original divine nature? gets himself entangled in the meshes of desire (Kama) and action (Karma)? and revolves in the wheel of birth and death. The individual soul turns towards ignorance without knowing his own true divine nature. The Jiva (individual soul) being overpowered by ignorance and the modifications? forgets its pristine purity and moves in various forms.The Primordial Nature or the Unmanifested is a dark matrix with infinite potentialities. It is not a substance. Sound and energy are in an undifferentiated state in It. The whole world gets involved into It during the cosmic dissolution. There is no relationship of substance or ality between It and the three Gunas. The alities are the Mulaprakriti and the latter is the former in a state of poise or eilibrium. This manifested world of the three alities is compared to a twisted rope of three colours? viz.? white? red and black. Each colour represents a Guna. Sattvic is white? Rajas is red and Tamas is black. The three are not in a state of eilibrium in the manifested world.Water and the seed coming in contact with the earth produce sprouts which grow into trees. In the womb of Nature? the seed develops into the eightfold elements -- earth? water? fire? air? ether? mind? intellect and egoism. The first fruit of the contact of Nature with the soul is the MahatTattva or intellect. From intellect mind is born from mind egoism from egoism? the five elements.There are four classes of beings? viz.? Jarayuja? Andaja? Svedaja and Udbhijja. The Jarayuja is born of the placenta (viviparous). Human beings? cows? elephants? horses? etc.? belong to this class. In this variety the five senses of knowledge exist. The Andaja is born of eggs (oviparous). In this variety the elements of wind and ether predominate. Lice come under the category of Svedaja they are born of sweat. In this variety fire and water predominate. Trees that are born of seeds are classified under the head Udbhijja in this variety earth and water predominate. (Cf.VII.6IX.17XV.7)",
        "PurPort": "This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to\nthe combination of kñetra and kñetra-jïa, the body and the spirit soul. This\ncombination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the\nSupreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic\nmanifestation; and that total substance of the material cause, in which there\nare three modes of nature, is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme\nPersonality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes\nbecome possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as\nBrahman in the Vedic literature (Muëòaka Upaniñad 1.1.19): tasmäd etad\nbrahma näma-rüpam annaà ca jäyate. The Supreme Person impregnates that\nBrahman with the seeds of the living entities. The twenty-four elements,\nbeginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, and they\nconstitute what is called mahad brahma, or the great Brahman, the material\nnature. As explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another,\nsuperior nature—the living entity. Into material nature the superior nature is\nmixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all\nliving entities are born of this material nature.\nThe scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the\nscorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.\nActually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not\nthe cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of.\nmaterial nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a\ndifferent body, created by this material nature, so that the entity can enjoy or\nsuffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the\nmanifestations of living entities in this material world."

Rajas comes next. Tamas is the lowest and the worst. The three alities indicate the triple mentality. They produce attachment in the individual souls? delude them and bind them down? as it were? to Samsara. Just as the three conditions of childhood? youth and old age are found in the same body? so also the three alities inhere in the mind. The soul gets limited by identifying itself with body and the three alities. It is subject to birth and death and experiences happiness and misery? pleasure and pain? joy and sorrow till it realises its identity with the supreme Self.The word Guna is usually translated as ality. It does not signify property? attribute or ality? such as the blue colour of a cloth. Gunas are really the primary constitutents of Nature and are the basis of all substances. Therefore it is not proper to call them alities inhering in substances.If you want to attain freedom or perfection? if you wish to become immortal? you must rise above the modes of Nature. You must transcend the Gunas.If the water in the vessel is agitated? the reflected sun in the water also appears to be agitated through Pratibimba Adhyasa (superimposition of reflection on water). Even so the pure unchanging Self appears to be bound by the alities of Nature through superimposition. In reality the Self is ever free and untainted. It is beyond them.The Gunas which are only forms of ignorance are ever dependent on the knower of the field. They bind? fast? as it were? the knower of the field. They have him as the basis of their existence.A knowledge of the Gunas and their operation is very necessary. Only if you have this knowledge can you free yourself from their clutches.Mahabaho Mightyarmed with strong and sinewy arms reaching down to the kness. This is a very auspicious sign. Yogis and sages have such beautiful arms.These three Gunas are present in all human beings. No one is free from the operation of any one of the three alities of Nature. They are not constant. Sometimes Sattva predominates at other times Rajas or Tamas predominates.Sattva has the characteristic of effulgence. It is also harmony and goodness or purity. Rajas is passion or activity. Tamas is inertia or darkness.Analyse all phenomena in terms of these three. Know their characteristics. Stand as a witness of these alities. Do not identify yourself with them. Separate yourself from them. Become a Gunatita. You will attain Supreme Peace? immortality and eternal bliss. (Cf.XIII.22)",
        "PurPort": "The living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this\nmaterial nature.

It lays for one the trap of happiness and knowledge. It is a golden fetter. A Sattvic man compares himself with others and rejoices in his excellence. He is puffed up with his knowledge. His heart is filled with pride when he thinks that he,has more comforts or more pleasant experiences. He thinks? I am happy I am wise? and so he is bound as it were. These ideas really belong to the field but they are transferred through superimposition to the Self on account of the force of SattvaGuna.Rajas and Tamas are pitfalls on the path of knowledge.This attachment to happiness is an illusion. This is ignorance. An attribute of the object cannot belong to the subject. All the alities from desire to firmness (Cf.XIII.6) belong to the field. From ignorance? nondiscrimination is born and so the individual self is not able to discriminate between the permanent and the impermanent? the subject and the object.Knowledge is an attribute of the Antahkarana (inner instrument? viz.? mind? intellect? the unconscious and the ego) but not of the Self. It if were an attribute of the Self? it could not produce attachment and bondage. Sattva binds the soul to knowledge through attachment.",
        "PurPort": "The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One\nis happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of\npsychological manifestations are causes of the entities’ conditioned status in.\nnature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of\nBhagavad-gétä. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of\ndeveloping the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes\nwiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not\nso much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in\nmaterial knowledge. The representative type is the brähmaëa, who is supposed\nto be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to\nunderstanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from\nsinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of\ngoodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.\nThe difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of\ngoodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and\nis better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples\nare the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and\nbecause they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of\nmaterial happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life\nmakes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they\nare attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they\nhave an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of\nbody in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of\nbeing transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a\nphilosopher, a scientist or a poet, and repeatedly become entangled in the same\ndisadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material\nenergy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant."

The Rajasic man is full of cravings and desires. The cravings force him to act for their fulfilment. He gets attached to those who help him in the fulfilment of his desire and hates those who stand in his way. He is attached to action. He enters on great undertakings. He performs various sorts of sacrifices and rituals and charitable activities. He runs after sensual pleasures and his desires become insatiable like a flame fed by oil. The Self is not the doer. It is the silent witness but Rajas creates in the man the idea? I am the doer.Rajas pleases the mind and keeps alive the passions.A Rajasic man is never contented. He is ever greedy and restless. The more he acires? the more passionate and greedy he becomes. Desires multiply. Nothing gives him satisfaction. If he is a millionaire? he tries to become a multimillionaire.

He is under intoxication of the pride of wealth. His intellect is turbid. He has a perverted intellect.

He thinks What will happen to me after my possessions are gone and thus worries himself unnecessarily and engages himself in endless activities. He has no peace of mind.He thirsts for what has not been attained and is attached to what has already been obtained. He wishes and tries to protect his possessions. This is Sanga. I will do such and such an action. I will get such and such a result. I will do this sacrifice. I will enjoy in heaven. This sort of clinging to action and its fruits is Karma Sanga.",

For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some\nhonor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with\nnice children, wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion.\nAs long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard.\nTherefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of\nhis activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his\nwife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work.\nTherefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion.\nModern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode\nof passion.

It causes delusion or nondiscrimination. It binds him who associates the Self with the body. A Tamasic man acts under the compulsion of the wants of the body. He has no power of judgment. Troubled by the wants of the body he acts under pressure to keep himself alive. His actions are not guided by reason. They are on the plane of instinct. His senses are dull.

The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of\ngoodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can\nunderstand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite.\nEveryone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a\nmadman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement,\none becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in.\nthe Vedic literature. Vastu-yäthätmya-jïänävarakaà viparyaya-jïäna-janakaà\ntamaù: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand a thing as it is. For\nexample, everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will\nalso die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is\nsure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all\nday and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their\nmadness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual\nunderstanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate\nfor spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even\nactive like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another\nsymptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more\nthan is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of\nignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be\nalways dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the\nsymptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance."

But if one wants, he can develop, by\npractice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and\npassion. One can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness\nand ignorance. Or one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness\nand passion. Although there are these three modes of material nature, if one is\ndetermined he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and by transcending\nthe mode of goodness he can be situated in pure goodness, which is called the\nvasudeva state, a state in which one can understand the science of God. By the\nmanifestation of particular activities, it can be understood in what mode of\nnature one is situated."

        "PurPort": "The result of pious activities in the mode of goodness is pure. Therefore the\nsages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. But activities in\nthe mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness\nis bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so\nmuch human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built.\nThe financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those\nwho are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil. The\nmiseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-gétä says that in any activity performed\nunder the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There\nmay be a little so-called mental happiness—“I have this house or this\nmoney”—but this is not actual happiness.\nAs far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without\nknowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and\nafterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable,\nalthough, under the spell of the illusory energy, mäyä, the animals do not\nunderstand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of\nignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will\nhave a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society,\nif one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of\nignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by\nthe Supreme Lord. Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord, and He\ndoes not tolerate even an ant’s being killed. One has to pay for it. So\nindulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of\nignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals, because God has\nsupplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be\nunderstood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark.\nOf all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the\ncow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of\nthe grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature (Åg Veda 9.4.64) the\nwords gobhiù préëita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by\nmilk, is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a\nprayer in the Vedic literature that states:\nnamo brahmaëya-deväya\ngo-brähmaëa-hitäya ca\njagad-dhitäya kåñëäya\ngovindäya namo namaù\n“My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brähmaëas, and You\nare the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.” (Viñëu Puräëa\n1.19.65) The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the\nprotection of the cows and the brähmaëas. Brähmaëas are the symbol of\nspiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these\ntwo living creatures, the brähmaëas and the cows, must be given all\nprotection—that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human\nsociety, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to\nbe understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction\nand is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides\nthe citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human\ncivilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the\nmodes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations\nshould take care to provide the easiest process, Kåñëa consciousness, to save\nhumanity from the greatest danger."

Otherwise, if the world\nis devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or\nprosperity. In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering\nfor sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough\nmoney and adequate arrangements for sense gratification, there is neither\nhappiness nor peace of mind. That is not possible, because one is situated in\nthe mode of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him;\nhe has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing Kåñëa\nconsciousness. When one is engaged in the mode of passion, not only is he\nmentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very\ntroublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough\nmoney to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of\nignorance, people become mad.

I am happy? miserable or deluded? on account of the attachment to the Gunas.The nature of the Gunas? their functions? how they bind a man to the Samsara? the effects of each Guna when it is predominant? and the plane reached by the man when he is under the influence of a particular Guna are described in the previous verses. Now the Lord describes in the following verse that liberation comes when one knows Him Who is above the three Gunas.",
        "PurPort": "In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more\nexplicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the\nheavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree\nof development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to\nvarious planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka,\nwhere the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahmä, resides. We have seen\nalready that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in\nBrahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring\nus to this.\nThe mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of\ngoodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be\npurely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a\nrich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this\nearth, in the mode of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the\nhigher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of\nbecoming mad in the next life..\nThe lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable.\nThe result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in\nmaterial nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of\nlife—birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc.—and according to the development of\nthe mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable\nconditions. The word tämasäù is very significant here. Tämasäù indicates\nthose who stay continuously in the mode of ignorance without rising to a\nhigher mode. Their future is very dark.\nThere is an opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to\nbe elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called Kåñëa\nconsciousness. But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity will\ncertainly continue in the lower modes"

The Gunas alone are responsible for all actions. I am entirely distinct from the alities. I am pure consciousness. I cannot be touched by the alities. I am like the ether.When a man gets illumination or attains knowledge of the Self? when he realises that there is no agent except the Gunas which are themselves modified as the bodies? the senses and their objects? when he knows that it is the Gunas only that become the agent in all transformations? in all states and in all actions? and when he realises the Supreme Self Who is distinct from the Gunas? Who is the silent witness of the Gunas and their functions? he attains to My state (liberation)? i.e.? becomes identical with Me. He becomes a Gunatita? i.e.? one who has transcended the three Gunas.",
        "PurPort": "One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply\nby understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real\nspiritual master is Kåñëa, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to\nArjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in Kåñëa consciousness that\none has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature.\nOtherwise, one’s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide\nspiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material\nbody, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the\nmaterial modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but\nwhen he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental\nplatform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not\nthe performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated\nin a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material\nnature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in\nwhat position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide\nspiritual master, he can see his real position, and by such an understanding he\ncan become fixed in full Kåñëa consciousness. A man in Kåñëa consciousness is\nnot controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been\nstated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to Kåñëa is\nrelieved from the activities of material nature. For one who is able to see\nthings as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases."

He ever enjoys the bliss of the Eternal. He attains release or Moksha. He attains to My Being.When the Lord said that the wise man crosses beyond the three alities and attains immortality? Arjuna became inspired with the desire of learning more about it. Just as he has asked a estion about the sage of steady wisdom in chapter II? verse 54? he now asks Lord Krishna about the characteristics of a sage who has crossed over the three alities. How does he act What is his conduct or behaviour How has he gone beyond the alities",
        "PurPort": "How one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in full\nKåñëa consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word dehé means\n“embodied.” Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in\nspiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature.\nHe can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after\nleaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this\nbody he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In other words, devotional service in\nKåñëa consciousness is the sign of liberation from material entanglement, and\nthis will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the\ninfluence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service."

Light is the effect of Sattva? activity of Rajas and delusion of Tamas. The liberated sage does not hate them when they are present. When Sattva shines he is not carried away by pride. He does not think? I am a vey learned man. When the impulse for action is awakened in the body or when there is a divine call for him to do work for the solidarity of the world (Lokasangraha) he does not hate any action and he does not regret it after the action is accomplished.

I am under the influence of heedlessness? torpor? sloth? laziness and indolence. Now I am under the influence of Rajas. I am forced to do activities. This is painful. I have fallen from my true nature. This gives me a lot of pain. Now Sattva predominates in me. I am attached to happiness and knowledge. I am proud of my learning and better status.The liberated sage who has transcended the Gunas does not thus hate them when they are present.A man of Sattva or Rajas or Tamas longs for light? action or inertia which first manifested themselves and disappeared. But a liberated sage or one who has gone beyond the three alities does not at all long for these states which have vanished. This mark or characteristic is an internal mental state. It cannot be perceived or detected by others. It can be felt by ones own self alone. If one is endowed with clairvoyant vision or the inner eye of intuition? he can directly behold the longins that arise in the mind of another man.In the following three verses the Lord gives His answer to Arjunas second estion What is the conduct of the sage who has crossed over the Gunas",

When he is actually out of the body, then he is out\nof the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of\nthe material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the\ndevotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will\nautomatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he\nacts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to\nKåñëa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material\nbody, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The\nqualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is\naloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to\nenjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally\nsituated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become\nfree from the influence of the modes of material nature.\nThe next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated\nperson. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and\ndishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not\naffected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in Kåñëa\nconsciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He\naccepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise\nhe has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes\neveryone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Kåñëa\nconsciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed\nand sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he\nhas nothing to do with material existence. Social and political issues do not\naffect him, because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and\ndisturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt.\nanything for Kåñëa, but for his personal self he does not attempt anything. By\nsuch behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated"

There is total abandonment of thoughts of sensual objects. Constant thinking of God is the sure means for crossing beyond the three alities of Nature.",
        "PurPort": "This verse is a reply to Arjuna’s third question: What is the means of\nattaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material\nworld is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not\nbe disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his\nconsciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kåñëa\nactivities. Kåñëa activities are known as bhakti-yoga—always acting for Kåñëa..\nThis includes not only Kåñëa, but His different plenary expansions such as\nRäma and Näräyaëa. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in\nthe service of any of the forms of Kåñëa, or of His plenary expansions, is\nconsidered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the\nforms of Kåñëa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal.\nSuch personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they\npossess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of\nKåñëa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these\nmodes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome\nthem easily. This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter. One\nwho surrenders unto Kåñëa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of\nmaterial nature. To be in Kåñëa consciousness or in devotional service means\nto acquire equality with Kåñëa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal,\nblissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the\nSupreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity, in his\nspiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as Kåñëa in quality. The difference\nof individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of\nbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and\nthe activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there.\nTherefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be\nno meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental\nposition with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal\nassistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification\nis to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in\nthe Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahmäpy eti. One can attain the Supreme\nBrahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively\nbecome one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his\neternal Brahman identity as an individual soul."

        "PurPort": "The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and\nhappiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.\nParamätmä, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental\nrealization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization\nof the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramätmä and the impersonal\nBrahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh\nChapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the\nSupreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with\nfragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material\nnature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the\ncultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of.\nmaterial existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the\nSupreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage\nin self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental\nto the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.\nIf he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then\ngradually rise up to Paramätmä realization and then to the realization of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic\nliterature. The four Kumäras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman\nconception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional\nservice. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of\nBrahman runs the risk of falling down. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that\nalthough a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going\nfurther, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not\nperfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform,\nthere is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional\nservice of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said, raso vai saù, rasaà hy\neväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati: “When one understands the Personality of\nGodhead, the reservoir of pleasure, Kåñëa, he actually becomes\ntranscendentally blissful.” (Taittiréya Upaniñad 2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full\nin six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of\nthese six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level\nwith the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal\nlife accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or\neternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already\npossessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.\nThe living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it\nover the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional\nposition, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but\nassociation with material nature entangles him in the different modes of\nmaterial nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of\nthese three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By\nengagement in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, he is\nimmediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to.\ncontrol material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional\nservice, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering—the prescribed nine\nmethods for realizing devotional service—should be practiced in the\nassociation of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the\nspiritual master, one’s material desire to dominate is removed, and one\nbecomes firmly situated in the Lord’s transcendental loving service. This\nmethod is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter.\nDevotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the\nservice of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity,\nsmell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the\nLord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the\nLord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the\ntranscendental vibration Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/\nHare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days\ncommemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His\ndevotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from\nall material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti or\nthe different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead in quality.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature."

This peepul is said to be eternal because it cannot be cut except by the axe of knowledge.All persons depend upon the Lord for the fruits of their actions? because He alone knows the right relation between the actions and their fruits. He alone is the dispenser of the fruits of actions of human beings. The wise persons also depend upon the Lord for the fruit of their knowledge. The Lord alone removes the veil of ignorance through His grace and mercy. The inclination for Advaita Vedantic Sadhana arises through the Lords grace. The desire for the realisation of the Oneness is produced in the minds of wise men by the grace of the Lord? which is the antidote to all fears. (Avadhuta Gita? I.1)Those who serve the Lord with unswerving or singleminded devotion go beyond the three alities of Nature through His grace. They attain knowledge of the Self through the grace of the Lord and get release from the round of birth and death. Those who have a right understanding of the real nature of Brahman or the Supreme Being also get emancipation easily.The Lord teaches Arjuna in this discourse about the real nature of Brahman or the Supreme Self and the path that leads the soul to union with Him. The Lord describes the nature of Samsara or worldly life as a peepul tree in order to create nonattachment or dispassion? because he who is endowed with true and lasting dispassion alone is fit for attaining the knowledge of the Self. Samsara is compared to a tree. because it can be cut off like a tree.All the other trees have their roots below? but this peculiar? strange and most wonderful tree of Samsara (Maya) has its root above? in Brahman. This peepul tree is different from all other trees. Brahman is the resting place or support of everything. It is eternal. It is great. It is the most high. It is the Supreme Being. It is supreme over all things. It is the source of everything. Therefore it is said that It is the One above. This One above is the root of this tree of Samsara. Brahan Who is superior to all is Urdhva. That which has Brahman as its cause is Urdhvamulam.In the Puranas it is said The tree of the Unmanifest has sprung from Brahman. Buddhi is its trunk? the senseopenings are its hollows? the great elements its boughs? the senseobjects its leaves and branches? Dharma and Adhrama (virtue and vice) its beautiful flowers? pleasure and pain its fruits. Having cut asunder this tree with the powerful sword of the knowledge of the Self? and then having attained to the eternal bliss of Brahman? no one comes back from there again.Brahman is the root of this tree. It is the upper part of this tree and so It is called Urdhva. In reality there are no distinctions such as upward? downward or middle in the One Which is the indivisible unity.The name Asvattha is usually derived from Asvattha which means not standing or enduring or remaining till tomorrow. A means not Sva means tomorrow Ttha means remaining. This is ite an appropriate word for this worldtree which is ever changing and passing away.In the Katha Upanishad also there is a mention about this Asvattha tree (II.6.1). The Gita is an essence of the Upanishads only.Samsara is generally understood by the common people as meaning remaining surrounded by ones wife and children and doing ones daily duties. This is a restricted or narrow meaning. Samsara means the whole worldprocess or the cosmic manifestation or the everchanging phenomenal world. Hiranyagarbha? the individual souls? the cosmic intelligence? egoism? the rootelements? etc.? represent the brancehs of this tree of Samsara. They extend downwards. They evolve into grosser and grosser states. Therefore it is said that the tree has its branches below. Egoism is the sprout which goes downwards in three directions? viz.? the three alities of Nature.Mind is the offshoot. Then come the five elements? viz.? earth? water? fire? air and ether? and the five organs of knowledge. Then comes sound which stimulates the ears to hear sweet music. Then comes touch which stimulates the skin to enjoy soft things. Then comes form which stimultaes the eye to behold beautiful objects. Then comes taste which stimulates the tongue to enjoy palatable things. Then comes smell which stimulates the nose to enjoy fragrant and scented objects.From the roots of actions with expectation of fruits a new branch of rirth comes up. The mineral kingdom? the vegetable kingdom? the animal kingdom and the human kingdom are all branches of this tree of Samsara. Man does good and evil actions with the help of the body and takes births to experience the fruits thereof. The human body is the water for this tree of Samsara.The body itself is the peepul tree. The root is the cerrospinal nervous system (brain). The various nerves are the branches that ramify downwards to the various organs distributed over the body.Avyaya Eternal? because this tree rests on an unbroken seires of births without beginning and end it is thus eternal. It can be cut down by the sword of knowledge of Brahman. Just as the leaves of a tree protect it? so also the Vedas protect this tree of Samsara? treating of virtue and vice? with their causes and fruits.He who knows this tree of Samsara and its roots as described above is a knower of the Vedas. He is a knower of the teachings of the Vedas. Not even an iota remains to be known beyond this tree of Samsara and its root. He who knows it is omniscient. The Lord has eulogised the knowledge of the tree of Samsara and its root in order to encourage aspirants to acire this knowledge.",
        "PurPort": "After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question,\n“What about the Vedas?” It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of\nVedic study is to understand Kåñëa. Therefore one who is in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.\nThe entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree.\nFor one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan.\ntree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree\nof this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree,\nthere is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating\noneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree’s roots grow upward because\nthey begin from where Brahmä is located, the topmost planet of this universe.\nIf one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out\nof it.\nThis process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it\nhas been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the\nmaterial entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that\ndevotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic\nprinciple of devotional service is detachment from material activities and\nattachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking\nattachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter.\nThe root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins\nfrom the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe.\nFrom there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches,\nrepresenting the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of\nthe living entities’ activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense\ngratification and liberation.\nNow, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its\nbranches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be\nfound beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect\nupon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the\ntree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual\nworld. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as a tree’s\nreflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things’ being situated in\nthis reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material\nexistence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he\ncan cut off his relationship with it.\nThis tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.\nEverything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to\nbe the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to Säìkhya.\nphilosophy, come prakåti, puruña, then the three guëas, then the five gross\nelements (païca-mahä-bhüta), then the ten senses (daçendriya), mind, etc. In\nthis way they divide up the whole material world into twenty-four elements. If\nBrahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a\nmanifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees\nconstitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection,\nso the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The\nprakåti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puruña is the\nSupreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-gétä. Since this\nmanifestation is material, it is temporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is\nsometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the\nreflection is reflected is eternal. The material reflection of the real tree has to\nbe cut off. When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he\nknows how to cut off attachment to this material world. If one knows that\nprocess, he actually knows the Vedas. One who is attracted by the ritualistic\nformulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He\ndoes not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as\ndisclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected\ntree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world."

Still higher is the Satyaloka where Hiranyagarbha dwells.From man down to the immovable objects below and from him up to the realm of the Creator above? whatever regions are attained in accordance with the nature of knowledge or action? they are the ramifying branches of the tree of Samsara. They are nurtured and fattened by the three Gunas which form their material base.The senseobjects such as sound? touch? colour? taste and smell represent the buds that sprout from the branches of the physical bodies which are the products of actions.The highest root of this wondeful tree is Brahman. The secondary roots are the latent impressions (Samskaras) of likes and dislikes? which spread in this world of men and impel them to perform virtuus and vicious actions and bind them fast to actions.Now listen to the way by which this tree can be cut off.

Sometimes we find that a tract of land\nis barren for want of sufficient water, and sometimes a tract is very green;\nsimilarly, where particular modes of material nature are proportionately\ngreater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested accordingly.\nThe twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects.

The tips of the\nbranches are the senses—the ears, nose, eyes, etc.—which are attached to the\nenjoyment of different sense objects. The twigs are sound, form, touch, and so\non—the sense objects.

O Arjuna Thou mayest perhaps consider that such a huge tree cannot be uprooted by any means whatever. It is not so. However firmly rooted it may be? it can be cut by the powerful axe of nnattachment or dispassion within the twinkling of an eye.After cutting this tree you will have to look within? meditate on the Self and behold the Supreme.Tatha As such As described above. Is it necessary to pull down castles in the air or to break the horns of a hare or to pluck a flower growing in the sky or to get butter from the milk of a tortoise or oil from stone Similarly? O Arjuna? there is no reality in this tree. Therefore why should you entertain any fear as to whether it may be uprooted or not Its form as such is not perceived by anybody here it is like a dream or a mirage or an imaginary city in the sky formed by the clouds or caused by a juggler. It appears and disappears. This tree has DrishtaNashtaSvarupa like the mirage. That object which is destroyed when one beholds it is DrishtaNashta. Nobody has perceived the end? the origin or the foundation of this illusory tree. No one can say that it has arisen from such and such a place or point.Samsara or the peepul tree is inveterately deeprooted. You will have to struggle hard to uproot it with its seed or the selfreproducing deep root.Asanga Dispassion? freedom from attachment to children? wealth and the world.Dridhena Strong. You will have to cut the tree with a strong axe which is sharpened again and again on the whetstone of the practice of discrimination. Further your mind should be turned towards the Supreme Being with the strong determination that you can attain eternal bliss only in Him and that He is the ony Reality.The desire for sensual pleasure is Sanga. Its opposite (dispassion) is Asanga. Renunciation of the three kinds of Eshanas (desires)? viz.? children? wealth and the world (PutraVittaLokeshana) is Asanga. Just as the axe cuts the tree? so also dispassion cuts this tree of Samsara. Hence dispassion is termed an axe. Cutting the tree of Samsara is annihilation of egoism? ignorance? latent tendencies? and renunciation of the fruits of all actions? through the practice of dispassion? control of the mind and the senses? etc. (Cf.VII.14)",

        "PurPort": "The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first\nqualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the\nconditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is\nvery difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nOne should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of\nmaterial nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is\nfree from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For\none who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not\npossible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for\nalthough one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the\nfoolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things\ncomplicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this\nimpression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human\nsociety, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they\nare the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society\nis the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he\nbecomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and\nnational affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world.\nAfter this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate\nknowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And\nwhen one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all\ndual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He\nbecomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead."

When It shines? everything shines after It? by Its light? all these shine (Chap.II?5.15). The same idea occurs in the Svetasvatara Upanishad (6.14) and the Mundaka Upanishad (II.2.10). The sun? the moon? etc.? derive their light from Para Brahman. Nothing else is needed for illuminating the Supreme Being because It is selfluminous.Dhama paramam Supreme abode or superexcellent seat or Para Brahman.Though the sun is endowed with the power of illumining all? it cannot illumine the Supreme Being.यत् धाम वैष्णवं पदं गत्वा प्राप्य न निवर्तन्ते यत् च सूर्यादिभिः न भासयते तत् धाम पदं परमं मम विष्णोः।That abode? to which having gone? none returns? and which the sun? moon? stars? lightning and fire do not illumine? is the highest abode of Vishnu.(Cf.VIII.21)",
        "PurPort": "The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nKåñëa—which is known as Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana—is described here.\nIn the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity,\nbecause all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this\nuniverse, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky\nare self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called\nVaikuëöhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually,\nthe effulgence is emanating from the planet of Kåñëa, Goloka Våndävana. Part\nof that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world.\nOther than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual\nplanets, which are called Vaikuëöhas, chief of which is Goloka Våndävana.\nAs long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional.\nlife, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false,\nperverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no\nchance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity\nconsiders himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state\nhe enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme\nLord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.\nOne should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer\nhimself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of\nreality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very\ndifficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Kåñëa consciousness there is\na chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with\ndevotees, those who are in Kåñëa consciousness. One should search out a\nsociety dedicated to Kåñëa consciousness and learn how to discharge\ndevotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material\nworld. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world\nsimply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the\ndevotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that\ndevotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get\nout of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the\ncontamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only\ndevotional service is described as purely transcendental.\nThe words paramaà mama are very important here. Actually every nook\nand corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is\nparamam, full of six opulences. The Kaöha Upaniñad (2.2.15) also confirms that\nin the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine, moonshine or stars (na\ntatra süryo bhäti na candratärakam), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated\nby the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can be\nachieved only by surrender and by no other means"

The individual soul is a ray of the Lord. A ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature? draws to itself the five senses and the mind and becomes an embodied soul (Jiva) by assuming a body. Here is a description of how the subtle body or LingaSariria enters the gross body.Although the sun is reflected in water? it is not in any way tainted. When a crystal comes in,contact with a red cloth or red flower? it seems to be red but it is really not so. Even so the Supreme Beings is not in any way tainted by the actions of the individual soul.Ignorance is the limiting adjunct of the individual soul. On account of the limitation caused by this ignorance the soul experiences that it is the doer and the enjoyer. In essence the individual soul is identical with the Supreme Being or Brahman. When ignorance? the limiting adjunct or principle? is destroyed? the individual soul (Jiva) realises it identity with the Supreme Being (Brahman).Just as the ether in the pot becomes one with the universal ether when the limiting adjunct? the pot? is broken? so also the individual soul becomes one with Brahman when the limiting adjunct? ignorance? is annihilated. Just as there is no return of the potether after it has become one with the universal ether when the pot is destroyed? so also there is no return of the individual soul after the limiting adjunct (the Antahkarana? i.e.? mind and the other inner instruments) is destroyed. It becomes one with Brahman.Pratibimba (reflection) is only a portion of the Bimba (object). The reflected sun is only a portion of the real sun (the rays of the sun). When the water is removed the reflected sun goes back to the original sun? as it were. It does not return to the water again. Even so? when ignorance or the mind is annihilated? the Jiva (individual soul) which is a reflection of Brahman in ignorance is absorbed in the Bimba Brahman. It does not return to this world of birth and death.The individual soul is only an imaginary or fictitious portion of Brahman. It is not a real portion. For the Supreme Being is indivisible. It has no parts. If It has parts? It would be liable to destruction when the parts are disjointed or removed.The senses abide in Nature? in their respective seats such as ear? skin? tongue? eye and nose. A Sannyasi living in the caves of the Himalayas dreams that he is a married man and moves about hither and thither to get a job for his livelihood. Even so? the individual soul forgets its real divine nature? mistakes the impure? perishable body for the pure? immortal Self and imagines that it is the real actor and enjoyer by identifying itself with the body. It says? I am the Karta. I am the Bhokta. I am a soul bound by Samsara. I am happy. I am miserable. It becomes finite.In essence the Jiva is identical with Brahman. The difference is on account of delusion or imagination or superimposition. The illusion of difference is due to the limiting adjunct or principle (the mind) even as the illusion that the ether in the pot is different from the universal ether is caused by the limiting adjunct? viz.? the pot. Jivabrahmabhedabhranti (the delusion of the distinctior between the individual soul and the Supreme Being) is removed when the limiting adjunct (mind) is annihilated. In deep sleep the mind rests in a subtle state along with all the Samskaras (impressions) and Vasanas (tendencies) in its cause (primordial ignorance). Again it comes back from this state of ignorance when you return to the waking state. If the cause (ignorance) is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self? its effect (mind) is also annihilated.Just as the tortoise stretches out its head and feet which were in a state of Laya (absorption) in its body? so also the individual soul strecthces out its mind and senses which were in a state of absorption in primordial ignorance in deep sleep? to enjoy the sensual objects in the waking state.A ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature? draws to itself the five senses and the mind In this verse the formation of the astral body (LingaSarira or Sukshmasarira) is described.The Sruti declaresस एष इह प्रविष्टः आनखाग्रेभ्यः तत् सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्।।That Supreme Being Itself? having created this aggregate of the body from the head to the toe? entered this body in the form of the Jiva.According to Vedanta there are nineteen principles? viz.? the five organs of knowledge? the five organs of action? the five vital airs (Prana? Apana? Vyana? Samana and Udana)? the mind? intellect? Chitta (the subconscious or the unconscious mind)? and egoism. We will have to conclude that the words the five senses and the mind point to the collection of the remaining thirteen principles also.Amsa This does not mean here a particle or portion which has been cut out. It is like the Amsar of the ether in the pot the ether is not cut out but still remains the whole ether. (Cf.XIV.3)",
        "PurPort": "In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living\nentity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord—eternally. It is\nnot that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated\nstate becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is\nclearly said, sanätanaù. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord\nmanifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the\nprimary expansions are called viñëu-tattva and the secondary expansions are\ncalled the living entities. In other words, the viñëu-tattva is the personal\nexpansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His\npersonal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord Räma,\nNåsiàhadeva, Viñëumürti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaikuëöha.\nplanets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors.\nThe personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the\nindividual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the\nseparated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental\nparts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental\nportions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as\nan individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of\nindependence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned\nsoul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case,\nhe is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is\nfreed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of\ntranscendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated\nby the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving\nservice of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his\nexistence in the material world.\nThe living entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even\nthe greater controllers of the material world—Brahmä, Lord Çiva and even\nViñëu—are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not\ntemporary manifestations. The word karñati (“struggling” or “grappling hard”)\nis very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by\niron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent\nwhich is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode\nof goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion,\nhis activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance,\nhe travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the\nconditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the\nsenses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his\nspiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity. The following\ninformation is there in the Mädhyandinäyana-çruti: sa vä eña brahma-niñöha\nidaà çaréraà martyam atisåjya brahmäbhisampadya brahmaëä paçyati brahmaëä\nçåëoti brahmaëaivedaà sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living\nentity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world,\nhe revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme.\nPersonality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to\nface, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. From småti also\nit is understood, vasanti yatra puruñäù sarve vaikuëöha-mürtayaù: in the\nspiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead’s. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference\nbetween the part-and-parcel living entities and the expansions of viñëu-mürti.\nIn other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThe words mamaiväàçaù (“fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme\nLord”) are also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is\nnot like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second\nChapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not\nmaterially conceived. It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and\njoined together again. That conception is not applicable here, because the\nSanskrit word sanätana (“eternal”) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal.\nIt is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that in each and every\nindividual body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present (dehino\n’smin yathä dehe). That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily\nentanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a\nspiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however,\nunderstood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of\nthe Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one with the Lord, just as the parts and\nparcels of gold are also gold"

Every\nliving entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances, he is living\nunder certain circumstances, and he is enjoying under certain circumstances\nunder the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of\nhappiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are\neverlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power to understand their\nchange of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend\nit.

Similarly, all these planets are floating in\nspace, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a\nhandful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of\nthe dust’s falling, but if one throws it in the air it will fall down. Similarly,\nthese planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the\nuniversal form of the Supreme Lord.

When the fire is not blazing there is\nno hunger, and when the fire is in order we become hungry. Sometimes when\nthe fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is\nrepresentative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras\n(Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad 5.9.1) also confirm that the Supreme Lord or\nBrahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all\nkinds of foodstuff (ayam agnir vaiçvänaro yo ’yam antaù puruñe yenedam annaà\npacyate). Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff,\nthe living entity is not independent in the eating process. Unless the Supreme\nLord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus produces.\nand digests foodstuff, and by His grace we are enjoying life. In the\nVedänta-sütra (1.2.27) this is also confirmed. Çabdädibhyo ’ntaù pratiñöhänäc ca:\nthe Lord is situated within sound and within the body, within the air and even\nwithin the stomach as the digestive force. There are four kinds of\nfoodstuff—some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are licked up, and some\nare sucked—and He is the digestive force for all of them."

        "PurPort": "The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart, and it is\nfrom Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything\nof his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme\nLord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to\nhis past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is\ngiven to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only\nall-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the\ndifferent fruitive results. He is worshipable not only as the impersonal\nBrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramätmä,\nbut as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the\nright direction to people so that they can properly mold their lives and come\nback to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and Kåñëa in His incarnation as Vyäsadeva is\nthe compiler of the Vedänta-sütra. The commentation on the Vedänta-sütra by\nVyäsadeva in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam gives the real understanding of\nVedänta-sütra. The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the\nconditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his\nactivity, and the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, the teacher of the Bhagavad-gétä. He is\nworshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.\nAntaù-praviñöaù çästä janänäm. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits\nhis present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.\nAlthough he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work\nwhere he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in\nthis world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in\nthe heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand the Vedas from Him.\nIf one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then Kåñëa gives\nthe required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for\nunderstanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand\nKåñëa. Vedic literature confirms this: yo ’sau sarvair vedair géyate. In all Vedic\nliterature, beginning from the four Vedas, Vedänta-sütra and the Upaniñads\nand Puräëas, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performance\nof Vedic rituals, discussion of the Vedic philosophy and worship of the Lord in.\ndevotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to\nunderstand Kåñëa. The Vedas give us direction by which to understand Kåñëa\nand the process of realizing Him. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead. Vedänta-sütra (1.1.4) confirms this in the following words: tat tu\nsamanvayät. One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding\nVedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can\napproach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no\nother than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the purpose of\nthe Vedas, the understanding of the Vedas, and the goal of the Vedas are\nclearly defined."

One is the individual soul called the perishable? the second is the imperishable or the Maya Sakti of the Lord and the third is the Purushottama or the Supreme Being.The perishable comprises the whole world of changing forms. From Brahma down to the tiny blade of grass? all movable and immovable objects? all that can be thought of by the mind? all that is made up of the five elements? all that is changing? all that has names and forms? all that appears to the naked eye and what is described as the body and the modifications of the field? in the thirteenth chapter? are Kshara or the perishable. Kshara is the changing one. It is the everchanging form of matter which is inert or insentient. Akshara is the changeless.In Samsara there are two categories arranged in two separate groups of beings? called Purushas? as they are the limiting adjuncts of the Purusha. Maya Sakti? the illusory power of the Lord? is the seed from which the perishable being takes its birth. It is the seat of all the latent impressions of desires? actions? etc.? of various perishable creatures. Maya Sakti is the Akshara Purusha. The unmanifest condition is generally described as deep ignorance or sleep for there is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. It is only a potential state. It is the condition in which all forms of life with its accompanying limitations lie latent? just as the tree lies latent in the seed of the fruit. In this state matter and energy are one. In this state sound? matter and energy exist in an undifferentiated state. In this state the Gunas exist in a state of eilibrium.The imperishable is known as the Kutastha? i.e.? that which remains immovable like a heap. That which is at the root (Kuta) of all these beings is the Kutastha. Or? Kuta also means illusion? and Kutastha means that which manifests itself in diverse forms of illusion. That which conceals the Truth and shows the false thing and deceives the worldyminded people is Maya or Kuta. That which is of the form of the AvaranaVikshepa Sakti (veiling and vacillating power) is Kutastha. As this Maya Sakti cannot be destroyed except by the knowledge of the Self? it is said to be endless. That is the reason why this is called Akshara. That seed of Samsara has no end. Therefore? it is said to be imperishable in the sense that it is not destroyed in the absence of knowledge of the Self. But the seed is scorched or destroyed in toto when one gets the knowledge of Brahman. The,illusion vanishes and everything is realised as the one Cosmic Consciousness. Only the illusory perception of matter is destroyed.Purushottama or the highest Purusha is distinct from these two -- the perishable and the imperishable. He is not affected by the evils of the two vehicles or limiting adjuncts of the perishable and the imperishable. He is eternal? pure? intelligent and free by nature.",
        "PurPort": "As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vyäsadeva compiled\nthe Vedänta-sütra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the\nVedänta-sütra. He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be\ndivided into two classes—the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are\neternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nWhen they are in contact with the material world they are called jéva-bhüta,\nand the Sanskrit words given here, kñaraù sarväëi bhütäni, mean that they are\nfallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nhowever, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no\nindividuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the\npurpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world there is no such thing\nas creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in the\nVedänta-sütra, is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.\nAccording to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord\nKåñëa, there are two classes of living entities. The Vedas give evidence of this,\nso there is no doubt about it. The living entities who are struggling in this\nworld with the mind and five senses have their material bodies, which are\nchanging. As long as a living entity is conditioned, his body changes due to\ncontact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be\nchanging. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore\nthere is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six\nchanges—birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and\nvanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual\nworld the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is\nno death. There all exists in oneness. Kñaraù sarväëi bhütäni: any living entity\nwho has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being,\nBrahmä, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all\nfallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness."

Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one\nmust be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should\nsimply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from\nBhagavad-gétä that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.

In the\nVaiñëava paramparä it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of\nKåñëa, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding\nthe Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the point, because he is\nengaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary\nprocesses of understanding.

The fifteenth discourse contains the intessence of the Gita? the Upanishads and the Vedas. This is the butter churned from the milk of the Vedas. It has been said that? He who knows the peepul tree knows the Veda (XV.1). The Lord has also said? It is I Who am to be known by all the Vedas (XV.15). Only when a man knows this science as taught above does he become wise -- but not otherwise. Whatever duty a Brahmana of the highest birth has to do? all that has been doen when one attains the knowledge of the Self. All actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge (IV.33). This is the fulfilment of the birth? particularly of a Brahmana because the twicorn accomplishes all his duties only by attaining to this? but not otherwise? says Manu Smriti.As you have heard from Me this truth about the Supreme Being? you are a happy man and you have done all your duties you have attained Selfrealistion.By using the words Anagha and Bharata? Lord Krishna hints that even when an ordinary man who knows this fifteenth discourse can attain knowledge of the Self and become a Kritakritya? then what to say of Arjuna who was sinless and who was born in a noble family with divine attributes The Lord? by using the word Anagha? also indicates that the Guru who is a knower of Brahman should instruct the most profound secret (the science of the Self) only to alified persons who are free from impurities of the heart or tossing of the mind? who are calm and endowed with the four means of salvation. The man of impure mind will not be able to grasp the truth. The sinful man with his perverted intellect will distort the truth and thus pave the way for the destruction of himself and his followers.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the fifteenth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Supreme Spirit.   ,,",
        "PurPort": "The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed\nscriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in\ntranscendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental\nservice, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of\nmaterial nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding.\nWherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot\ncoexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the\nsame because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the\ninternal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and\nignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of\ndarkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper\nguidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.\nEveryone must take to this consciousness of Kåñëa and engage in devotional\nservice to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of\nunderstanding Kåñëa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he\nmay be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.\nThe word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, “O\nsinless one,” means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very\ndifficult to understand Kåñëa. One has to become free from all contamination,\nall sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure\nand potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically\ncomes to the stage of sinlessness.\nWhile one is performing devotional service in the association of pure\ndevotees in full Kåñëa consciousness, there are certain things which require to\nbe vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is\nweakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over\nmaterial nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the\nSupreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the\npropensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and.\nthe possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these\nweaknesses of the heart. In this chapter the first five verses describe the\nprocess of freeing oneself from these weaknesses of heart, and the rest of the\nchapter, from the sixth verse through the end, discusses puruñottama-yoga.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of Puruñottama-yoga, the Yoga of the Supreme\nPerson."

Asuras and Rakshasas? in the ninth discourse (verses 12 and 13). He now describes them in detail in this discourse. The distinction between the god or the godman and the Asuras is clearly drawn in the first? second? third and fourth verses. Daivi Prakriti or the nature of the gods leads to Moksha or release from the round of birth and death. The nature of the Asuras and Rakshasas leads to bondage. This is an obstacle to the attainment of knowledge of the Self. The divine nature must be accepted and cultivated the Asuric and Rakshasic nature should be abandoned. All these alities are found in human beings. There are Sattvic people who possess the divine attributes there are Asuras and Rakshasas among human beings also? who are endowed with demoniacal alities? who are filled with excessive Tamas. In an ordinary man there is a mixture of the three Gunas. Tamas and Rajas pull a man downwards Sattva lifts a man upwards. Tamas and Rajas lead to bondage Sattva helps to attain salvation. Discipline yourself and develop Sattva This is the foundation of Yoga. This is the first preparatory discipline. The first rung in the spiritual ladder is reached by developing Sattva. When the mind is Sattvic? thee is calmness in it. Divine light can descend only when the mind is serene and cheerful.The Sattvic man controls the senses? does selfless service? and practises Japa? Pranayama? concentration? meditation? selfanalysis and eniry of Who am I He is not attracted by sensual objects. He has a burning desire for attaining Moksha. He is humble? generous? merciful? forbearing? tolerant and pious. He destroys his little personality. The Rajasic man is proud? intolearnt? egoistic? selfsufficient? lustful? hottermpered? greedy and jealous. He works for his own glory and fame and selfaggrandisement. he develops his own little vain personality.There is intimate connection between the Gunas and Karmas. The nature of the Karmas depends upon the nature of the Gunas. A Sattvic man will do virtuous actions. A Rajasic and Tamasic man will perform evil actions. It is the Guna that goads a man to do actions. The Self or Brahman is actionless. It is the silent witness.The Lord sums up in the first three verses the alities of a godly man who is inclined to the path of liberation. He then enumerates the alities of the demoniacal man. The theme of this chapter is the tracing of the difference between the divine and the Asuric nature.Virtue and vice are relative terms. The virtue of one period will become the vice of the other. From the transcendental point of view? there is neither virtue nor vice.Why should there be evil How did evil arise -- these are all transcendental estions (Atiprasnas). You can get answers to these estions only when you attain Selfrealisation. People unnecessarily rack their brains to get an answer to these estions. It is a serious mistake.Daivi Sampat (divine wealth or the wealth of divine alities) helps the aspirant to attain knowledge of the Self. The Sattvic or divine attributes such as fearlessness? purity of heart? control of the senses? etc.? constitute Daivi Sampat. They enable the aspirant to attain the highest state of superconsciousness (Nirvikalpa Samadhi) wherein the seer and the seen are united in one? the meditator and the meditated become identical. Divine alities or attributes which go to augment the bliss of the Self? which help the aspirant to attain the happiness of the Self? are called divine,wealth.Among the divine alities? fearlessness stands foremost. Fear is an effect of ignorance. Identification with the body causes fear. Blind attachment to the body? wife? children? house or property is the cause of fear. The sge who has realised the Self is absolutely fearless.He who knows the Bliss of Brahman from which words as well as the mind turn powerless? fears nothing. (Taittiriya Upanishad)Fearlessness is the devout observance of the precepts enjoined in the scriptures without doubting. The state of being free from the fear? How can I live now when I have renounced everything? when I have none to support me is fearlessness. A Sannyasi resolves when he takes Sannyasa? I will not induce fear in any living creature. Keeping up this resolve of Abhaya Dana (gift of the boon of fearlessness to all creatures) in thought? word and deed is Abhayam or fearlessness. Fear can be removed by constant thinking of the immortal and allblissful nature of the Self. If you lead a life of honesty and truthfulness? if you devoutly observe the precepts of the scriptures without doubting? if you lead a life of right conduct? and if you remember God always? you will become fearless. When one beholds the Self only everywhere? when the sense of duality has vanished? when the sense of unity has dawned in him? how can he be afraid of anything? how can the feeling of fear arise in him Fearlessness is essential for the attainment of Moksha or salvation. Fearlessness is the chief characteristic of a liberated sage. It is the one accurate measure of ones spiritual progress. It is the cardinal virtue of an illumined sage. That is the reason why it is placed in the forefront of all divine alities. Only a liberated sage can be absolutely fearless.Sattvic Subha Vasana (good tendency) is Daivi Sampat. It induces a man to practise discrimination? dispassion? control of the mind and the senses? etc.? which help him to attain knowledge of the Self. The Rajasic and the Tamasic (Asubha or evil) Vasnas (tendencies) which operate along the currents of RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes)? which induce one to perform actions which are prohibited by the scriptures and which produce disastrous effects? constitute demoniacal nature.In Asuric nature inclination towards sensual pleasures is predominant in Rakshasic nature hatred predominates and the Rakshasa does various sorts of harm and injury to others.Good tendencies lead to Moksha. Evil tendencies lead to bondage. Good tendencies must be cultivated. Evil tendencies should be eradicated. You shoul first have a knowledge of the essential nature of these two Vasanas? if you wish to cultivate the good tendencies and eradicate the evil ones. This sixteenth discourse gives a vivid description of these tendencies.Sattvasamsuddhih Purity of understanding? cleanliness of life or purity of heart. Purity of mind? i.e.? giving up of cheating? hypocrisy? untruth and the like? in all dealings with the people? and doing transactions with perfect honesty and integrity is Sattvasamsuddhi.When the understanding abides constantly in the immortal Self and is thus firm and steadfast? you may know this to be a condition of purity. On account of purity the mind can know the Self. The state of the mind wherein it is free from doubts like Asambhavana (thought of improbability of the existence of the Self)? etc.? through hearing of the scriptures is Sattvasamsuddhi. As purity of mind cannot be obtained without devotion to the Lord? devotion is implied in these Sattvic virtues.Jnana Knowledge understanding the nature of the Self? as taught in the scriptures and by the preceptor Selfrealisation through meditation on the Great Sentence of the Upanishad. I am Brahman (Aham Brahmasmi)? is Jnana.Yoga is union of the individual soul with the Supreme Being it is the direct realisation of the Self by concentration and meditation? through selfrestraint or control of the senses. The aspirant cognises through direct perception by the inner eye of intuition or wisdom what has been learnt from the scriptures and the preceptor. The aspirant attains Selfrealisation or direct knowledge. He becomes one with Brahman -- the Absolute. He gets indirect knowledge or mere understanding or theoretical knowledge of Brahman from the scriptures. Now through the practice of Yoga he gets direct knowledge. The attempt which is favourable for the annihilation of the mind and the latent tendencies is also known as Yoga.Jnanayogavyavasthitih The state of Jivanmukti attained through Jnana Yoga? which is distinct from the state of the worldlyminded persons.Fearlessness? purity of heart and steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga are the three preeminent virtues amongst the Sattvic attributes enumerated in verses 1 to 3. They are found in Jnana Yogins only. The other alities are common to Jnana Yogins? Karma Yogins? Raja Yogins and Bhaktas. Unless you possess Sattvic virtues? you cannot practise any kind of Yoga. If you cultivate one virtue? all other virtues will cling to you by themselves. Fearlessness is the basis and foundation of the whole of mans moral structure within.Svadhyaya and Tamas constitute Kriya Yoga. Svadhyaya constitutes BrahmaYajna. Almsgiving and sacrifice pertain to Karma Yoga. Almsgiving? selfcontrol and sacrifice constitute Daivi Sampat for householders. Those alities mentioned in chapter XVI? verses 1 to 3? which belong to the aspirant who practises a particular form of Yoga constitute the Daivi Sampat of the disciple on that path.Dana Almsgiving distributing food? clothes? etc.? as far as it iles in ones power? according to ones means. A charitable man hastens to comfort the distressed and helps the needy. Charity is of three kinds? viz.? Sattvic? Rajasic and Tamasic (see chapter XVII? 20 to 22). It opens the gates of heaven. It will bring nearer the means of liberation. Just as the tree gives fruit and shade without distinction? so also give to him who needs? without distinction? with a cheerful heart.Dama Selfrestraint? selfcontrol? control of the external senses. The control of the inner senses or the mind is described in the next verse.The practice of selfcontrol annihilates the union between the senses and the sensual objects. It separates the senses from their respective objects. The aspirant will not allow the wind of the sensual objects to blow through the gateway of his senses. He keeps the senses under the strictest restraint. He lights the fire of dispassion at all the ten gates of the body. He takes rigid vows. He observes Mauna (the vow of silence) and celibacy. He is moderate in his diet. He keeps the golden medium in everything. He checks the outgoing tendencies of the mind and the senses. He induces the mind and the senses to turn backwards towards their source. Just as an enemy is cut down by means of a weapon? so also every tendency towards sensual objects is cut down by the practice of selfcontrol. All internal promptings? cravings and Vasanas should be burnt in the fire of renunciation? at the ten gates of the senses. As householders cannot practise perfect control of the senses? even moderation or regulated and disciplined life will constitute selfrestraint for them. The practice of selfcontrol includes forgiveness? harmlessness? truth? steadiness and,patience.Yajna Sacrifice. The fireworship (Agnihotra) and the like enjoined in the Vedas and also the sacrifice to the gods (DevaYajna) or worship of the gods? PitriYajna? BhutaYajna? ManushyaYajna and BrahmaYajna enjoined in the scriptures (Smritis).Svadhyaya Study of the Vedas in order to attain the unseen fruits.Tapas Austerity? moritification of the body and other forms of penance. True Tapas is meditation on the Self. It is fixing the mind on Brahman or the Self. It is to separate oneself from the physical body and the other four sheaths and to identify oneself with the Absolute. It is to turn the mind towards the soul. The three kinds of Tapas mentioned in chapter XVII? verses 14 to 16 come under this category.Arjavam Straightforwardness. This is conducive to the attainment of knowledge. The aspirant should always be candid? upright or straightforward. Straightforwardness should be his constant attitutde. A just and truthful man alone can be straightforward. He is respected by the people. He is liked by all. He attains success in all his endeavours. He never hides facts or truth.",
        "PurPort": "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material\nworld was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the\nactivities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the\nNinth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or\ndemons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode\nof goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation,\nand such activities are known as daivé prakåti, transcendental by nature. Those\nwho are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of\nliberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on\nthe other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to\nremain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the\nspecies of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord\nexplains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the\ndemoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and\ndisadvantages of these qualities.\nThe word abhijätasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities\nor godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere\nis known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhädhäna-saàskära. If the parents\nwant a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles\nrecommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-gétä we have\nstudied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kåñëa Himself. Sex\nlife is not condemned, provided the process is used in Kåñëa consciousness.\nThose who are in Kåñëa consciousness at least should not beget children like\ncats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become Kåñëa conscious\nafter birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father and.\nmother absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness.\nThe social institution known as varëäçrama-dharma—the institution\ndividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational\ndivisions or castes—is not meant to divide human society according to birth.\nSuch divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the\nsociety in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are\nexplained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in\nspiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world.\nIn the varëäçrama institution the sannyäsé, or the person in the renounced\norder of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social\nstatuses and orders. A brähmaëa is considered to be the spiritual master of the\nthree other sections of a society, namely, the kñatriyas, the vaiçyas and the\nçüdras, but a sannyäsé, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be\nthe spiritual master of the brähmaëas also. For a sannyäsé, the first\nqualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyäsé has to be alone without\nany support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one thinks, “After I leave my\nconnections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order\nof life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead in His localized aspect as Paramätmä is always within, that He is\nseeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus\nhave firm conviction that Kåñëa as Paramätmä will take care of a soul\nsurrendered to Him. “I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live\nin the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will\ngive me all protection.” That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness. This\nstate of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.\nThen he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and\nregulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all,\na sannyäsé is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a\nwoman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord\nCaitanya was an ideal sannyäsé, and when He was at Puré His feminine\ndevotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised\nto bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a\nclass, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyäsé not to have close\nconnections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a\nparticular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyäsé, intimate\nrelations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are\nstrictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can\nlearn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is\nconsidered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most\nfallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the\nsannyäsa order of life in connection with association with woman. One of His\npersonal associates, namely Choöa Haridäsa, was associated with Lord\nCaitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow\nor other this Choöa Haridäsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord\nCaitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His\npersonal associates. Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyäsé or anyone who is\naspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate\nhimself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him,\nlooking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification—not\neven enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity—is\nso condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such\nillicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.\nThe next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of\nknowledge. Sannyäsé life is meant for distributing knowledge to the\nhouseholders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual\nadvancement. A sannyäsé is supposed to beg from door to door for his\nlivelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of\nthe qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer\nhumility the sannyäsé goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of\nbegging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness.\nThis is the duty of a sannyäsé. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his\nspiritual master, he should preach Kåñëa consciousness with logic and\nunderstanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the\nrenounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of\nlife without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing.\nfrom a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyäsé, or one in\nthe renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhi\n(purity) and jïäna-yoga (knowledge).\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\npercent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world.\nThus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are\nengaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are\ndifferent kinds of charity, as will be explained later on—charity in the modes\nof goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is\nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and\nignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity\nshould be given only to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world. That\nis charity in the mode of goodness.\nThen as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for\nother orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder.\nAlthough he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life\nunnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,\nwhich should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not\nrequire children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society\nenjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to\navoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality,\nbut is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress\nin spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child\nwithout the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If he is able to beget children who will\nbe in Kåñëa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without\nthis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because\nsacrifices require a large amount of money. Those in other orders of life,\nnamely brahmacarya, vänaprastha and sannyäsa, have no money; they live by\nbegging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the\nhouseholders. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the\nVedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive,\nand it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice\nrecommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa. This saìkértana-yajïa, the\nchanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive\nsacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items,\nnamely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the\nhouseholder.\nThen svädhyäya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life.\nBrahmacärés should have no connection with women; they should live a life of\ncelibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of\nspiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäya.\nTapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not\nremain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that\nthere are four divisions of life—brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and\nsannyäsa. So after gåhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for\na hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five\nin householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the\nrenounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious\ndiscipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the\nbody, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire varëäçrama-dharma society\nis meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get\nliberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go\non speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the\nVedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gétä. Such theories are manufactured by\nshow-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are\nrestrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore\nthose who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only,\ndon’t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is\nnot approved by the Vedas.\nAs far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should\na particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the\nbrahmacäré äçrama, gåhastha äçrama, vänaprastha äçrama or sannyäsa äçrama.\nOne should be very simple and straightforward..\nAhiàsä means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One\nshould not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the\nkilling of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification.\nPeople are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply\nof grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This\ninjunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an\nanimal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an\nample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make\nadvancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals.\nReal ahiàsä means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also\nmaking progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category\nof animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is\nchecked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so\nmany years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form\nof life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another\nspecies of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s\npalate. This is called ahiàsä.\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some\npersonal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the\nmeaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\nThat is the process for understanding the Vedas. Çruti means that one should\nhear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his\npersonal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä that\nmisinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be\npresented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\nAkrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be\ntolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger\nis a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally\nsituated should check himself from anger. Apaiçunam means that one should\nnot find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a\nthief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very\nmuch offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hré means\nthat one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is\nabominable. Acäpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated\nor frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one\nshould not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and\ndetermination.\nThe word tejas used here is meant for the kñatriyas. The kñatriyas should\nalways be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should\nnot pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\nBut a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions\nshow forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses.\nÇaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings\nalso. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in\nthe black market. Näti-mänitä, not expecting honor, applies to the çüdras, the\nworker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the\nlowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary\nprestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the\nçüdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\nAll these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.\nThey should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and\noccupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are\nmiserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men,\nthen gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental\nrealization."

        "PurPort": "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material\nworld was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the\nactivities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the\nNinth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or\ndemons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode\nof goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation,\nand such activities are known as daivé prakåti, transcendental by nature. Those\nwho are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of\nliberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on\nthe other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to\nremain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the\nspecies of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord\nexplains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the\ndemoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and\ndisadvantages of these qualities.\nThe word abhijätasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities\nor godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere\nis known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhädhäna-saàskära. If the parents\nwant a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles\nrecommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-gétä we have\nstudied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kåñëa Himself. Sex\nlife is not condemned, provided the process is used in Kåñëa consciousness.\nThose who are in Kåñëa consciousness at least should not beget children like\ncats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become Kåñëa conscious\nafter birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father and.\nmother absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness.\nThe social institution known as varëäçrama-dharma—the institution\ndividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational\ndivisions or castes—is not meant to divide human society according to birth.\nSuch divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the\nsociety in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are\nexplained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in\nspiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world.\nIn the varëäçrama institution the sannyäsé, or the person in the renounced\norder of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social\nstatuses and orders. A brähmaëa is considered to be the spiritual master of the\nthree other sections of a society, namely, the kñatriyas, the vaiçyas and the\nçüdras, but a sannyäsé, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be\nthe spiritual master of the brähmaëas also. For a sannyäsé, the first\nqualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyäsé has to be alone without\nany support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one thinks, “After I leave my\nconnections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order\nof life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead in His localized aspect as Paramätmä is always within, that He is\nseeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus\nhave firm conviction that Kåñëa as Paramätmä will take care of a soul\nsurrendered to Him. “I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live\nin the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will\ngive me all protection.” That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness. This\nstate of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.\nThen he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and\nregulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all,\na sannyäsé is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a\nwoman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord\nCaitanya was an ideal sannyäsé, and when He was at Puré His feminine\ndevotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised\nto bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a\nclass, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyäsé not to have close\nconnections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a\nparticular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyäsé, intimate\nrelations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are\nstrictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can\nlearn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is\nconsidered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most\nfallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the\nsannyäsa order of life in connection with association with woman. One of His\npersonal associates, namely Choöa Haridäsa, was associated with Lord\nCaitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow\nor other this Choöa Haridäsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord\nCaitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His\npersonal associates. Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyäsé or anyone who is\naspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate\nhimself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him,\nlooking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification—not\neven enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity—is\nso condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such\nillicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.\nThe next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of\nknowledge. Sannyäsé life is meant for distributing knowledge to the\nhouseholders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual\nadvancement. A sannyäsé is supposed to beg from door to door for his\nlivelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of\nthe qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer\nhumility the sannyäsé goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of\nbegging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness.\nThis is the duty of a sannyäsé. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his\nspiritual master, he should preach Kåñëa consciousness with logic and\nunderstanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the\nrenounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of\nlife without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing.\nfrom a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyäsé, or one in\nthe renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhi\n(purity) and jïäna-yoga (knowledge).\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\npercent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world.\nThus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are\nengaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are\ndifferent kinds of charity, as will be explained later on—charity in the modes\nof goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is\nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and\nignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity\nshould be given only to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world. That\nis charity in the mode of goodness.\nThen as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for\nother orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder.\nAlthough he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life\nunnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,\nwhich should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not\nrequire children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society\nenjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to\navoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality,\nbut is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress\nin spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child\nwithout the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If he is able to beget children who will\nbe in Kåñëa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without\nthis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because\nsacrifices require a large amount of money. Those in other orders of life,\nnamely brahmacarya, vänaprastha and sannyäsa, have no money; they live by\nbegging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the\nhouseholders. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the\nVedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive,\nand it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice\nrecommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa. This saìkértana-yajïa, the\nchanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive\nsacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items,\nnamely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the\nhouseholder.\nThen svädhyäya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life.\nBrahmacärés should have no connection with women; they should live a life of\ncelibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of\nspiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäya.\nTapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not\nremain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that\nthere are four divisions of life—brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and\nsannyäsa. So after gåhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for\na hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five\nin householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the\nrenounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious\ndiscipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the\nbody, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire varëäçrama-dharma society\nis meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get\nliberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go\non speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the\nVedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gétä. Such theories are manufactured by\nshow-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are\nrestrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore\nthose who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only,\ndon’t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is\nnot approved by the Vedas.\nAs far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should\na particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the\nbrahmacäré äçrama, gåhastha äçrama, vänaprastha äçrama or sannyäsa äçrama.\nOne should be very simple and straightforward..\nAhiàsä means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One\nshould not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the\nkilling of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification.\nPeople are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply\nof grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This\ninjunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an\nanimal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an\nample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make\nadvancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals.\nReal ahiàsä means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also\nmaking progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category\nof animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is\nchecked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so\nmany years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form\nof life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another\nspecies of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s\npalate. This is called ahiàsä.\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some\npersonal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the\nmeaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\nThat is the process for understanding the Vedas. Çruti means that one should\nhear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his\npersonal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä that\nmisinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be\npresented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\nAkrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be\ntolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger\nis a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally\nsituated should check himself from anger. Apaiçunam means that one should\nnot find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a\nthief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very\nmuch offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hré means\nthat one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is\nabominable. Acäpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated\nor frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one\nshould not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and\ndetermination.\nThe word tejas used here is meant for the kñatriyas. The kñatriyas should\nalways be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should\nnot pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\nBut a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions\nshow forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses.\nÇaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings\nalso. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in\nthe black market. Näti-mänitä, not expecting honor, applies to the çüdras, the\nworker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the\nlowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary\nprestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the\nçüdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\nAll these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.\nThey should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and\noccupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are\nmiserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men,\nthen gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental\nrealization."

A sannyäsé, or one in\nthe renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhi\n(purity) and jïäna-yoga (knowledge).\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\npercent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world.\nThus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are\nengaged in that way.

The best sacrifice\nrecommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa. This saìkértana-yajïa, the\nchanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive\nsacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items,\nnamely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the\nhouseholder.\nThen svädhyäya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life.\nBrahmacärés should have no connection with women; they should live a life of\ncelibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of\nspiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäya.\nTapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not\nremain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that\nthere are four divisions of life—brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and\nsannyäsa. So after gåhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for\na hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five\nin householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the\nrenounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious\ndiscipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the\nbody, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire varëäçrama-dharma society\nis meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get\nliberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go\non speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the\nVedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gétä. Such theories are manufactured by\nshow-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are\nrestrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore\nthose who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only,\ndon’t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is\nnot approved by the Vedas.\nAs far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should\na particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the\nbrahmacäré äçrama, gåhastha äçrama, vänaprastha äçrama or sannyäsa äçrama.\nOne should be very simple and straightforward..\nAhiàsä means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One\nshould not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the\nkilling of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification.\nPeople are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply\nof grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This\ninjunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an\nanimal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an\nample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make\nadvancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals.\nReal ahiàsä means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also\nmaking progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category\nof animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is\nchecked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so\nmany years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form\nof life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another\nspecies of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s\npalate. This is called ahiàsä.\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some\npersonal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the\nmeaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\nThat is the process for understanding the Vedas. Çruti means that one should\nhear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his\npersonal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä that\nmisinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be\npresented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\nAkrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be\ntolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger\nis a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally\nsituated should check himself from anger. Apaiçunam means that one should\nnot find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a\nthief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very\nmuch offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hré means\nthat one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is\nabominable. Acäpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated\nor frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one\nshould not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and\ndetermination.\nThe word tejas used here is meant for the kñatriyas. The kñatriyas should\nalways be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should\nnot pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\nBut a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions\nshow forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses.\nÇaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings\nalso. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in\nthe black market. Näti-mänitä, not expecting honor, applies to the çüdras, the\nworker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the\nlowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary\nprestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the\nçüdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\nAll these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.\nThey should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and\noccupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are\nmiserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men,\nthen gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental\nrealization."

Lord Krishna implies that Arjuna has no demonical alities in him as he is born in a noble family and is the son of Pritha.People of Asuric nature have no faith. They dispute every doctrine.

They have no idea of right conduct? purity and selfrestraint.Asuras are those persons who have waged war and who still wage war with the gods in heaven. Those who are endowed with Asuric tendencies or evil alities are Asuras or demons. They exist in abundance in this iron age. Kamsa was an Asura. Hiranyakasipu was an Asura.Even a man of university alitifactions and titles is a veritable Asura if he is endowed with evil tendencies or Asubha Vasanas.Esoterically? the war between the Asuras and the gods is the internal fight that is ever going on between the pure and the impure tendencies in man? between Sattva and RajasTamas.",

They do\nnot know what should be done and what should not be done. They do\neverything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not\nrecognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from\nthe beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow\nthey manifest all these inauspicious qualities."

Especially among the\nÄryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most\nadvanced civilized peoples, those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions\nare supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not\nknow the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them.\nMost of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have\nnot the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to\nact in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either\nexternally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body clean.\nby bathing, brushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal\ncleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God\nand chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all\nthese rules for external and internal cleanliness.\nAs for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human\nbehavior, such as the Manu-saàhitä, which is the law of the human race. Even\nup to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saàhitä. Laws of\ninheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the\nManu-saàhitä it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom.\nThat does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like\nchildren. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they\nare kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they\nthink that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has\nnot improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be\ngiven protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the\nfather in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup\nsons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the\nManu-saàhitä. But modern education has artificially devised a puffed-up\nconcept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an\nimagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good\nnow. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for\nsociety, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the\nrules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the\ndemoniac people is very miserable."

He is given an opportunity to\naccumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply\nthinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac\nperson believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma.\nAccording to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or\nbecomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in\nthe past. The demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to\nthe strength of one’s personal ability.

Whatever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in\nGod. Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings.\nAlthough the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or\neven more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more\ninfluential than he. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is\nconcerned, he does not believe in performing yajïas, or sacrifices. Demons\nthink that they will manufacture their own process of yajïa and prepare some\nmachine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best\nexample of such a demoniac man was Rävaëa. He offered a program to the\npeople by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the\nheavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the\nVedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach.\nthe higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangements. These are examples\nof bewilderment.

They abuse and illtreat all those people who are truthful and charitable? and who are devoted to Me.Ahamkaram Egoism The selfarrogating principle? the effect or modification of ignorance. This is the source of all the defects and perversities in human nature and of all evil actions. Lust? anger? greed? pride and hypocrisy are all attendants of egoism. It is very difficult to overcome this dire enemy? but through Vichara (right eniry) it can be annihilated.These Asuras who are very egoistic on account of their deep ignorance esteem themselves very highly for the alities they possess and for those which they falsely superimpose upon themselves. They think that they are very great persons on account of the good alities which they have superimposed upon themselves and their egoism is increased thery. They try to humiliate others by using their financial supremacy. They will bribe people to give false evidence and do anything to attain their selfish ends.Balam Power accompanied by lust and attachment. The Asuras use their strength of body to humiliate and destroy others. If a man is not established in Yama (the fivefold canon of ethical perfection? consisting of noninjury? truthfulness? nonstealing? celibacy and noncovetousness)? if he has no purity of heart? if his mind is surcharged or saturated with evil tendencies? and if he gets power of any sort? he will misuse or abuse it and try to humiliate or abuse others. Powers or Siddhis are bound to come if one practises concentration of mind. If he is endowed with Yama? he will never misuse them and so he will never have a downfall. That is the reason why Patanjali Maharshi says Powers are obstacles on the path of Yoga. Shun them ruthlessly. March onwards to the goal. Climb the ladder of Yoga till you attain the highest state of superconsciousness or Godconsciousness. Do not look back. Have no memories of the past.Yama is the very foundation of Yoga. Get yourself established in Yama before you take to concentration and meditation. Many aspirants get a downfall because they do not practise Yama to begin with. They jump at once to the practice of concentration and meditation. This is sad mistake.Darpa Haughtiness. A man whose heart is filled with haughtiness becomes very insolent and unjust and assumes an overbearing and domineering attitude towards others he never respects the elders? Gurus and others. This is a peculiar vice that has its seat in the mind. When this evil ality manifests itself? one swerves from the path of virtue.Krodha Anger manifests itself when one gets something unplesant and when he comes across something disagreeable.These Asuras hate Me? the Lord Who dwells in their own bodies as the silent witness of their thoughts and actions. They think that I am also a human being and hate Me. They do not understand My allpervading and imperishable nature. They do not care at all to know and follow. My ?nds or the injunctions given in the Vedas and the Smritis. If anyone violates My ?nds given in the scriptures? it is surely tantamount to an act of hatred towards Me. These people are very malicious. They have evil intentions or impure motives. They are jealous of those persons who are virtuous and who tread the path of righteousness. Their hearts burn when they notice good alities in others. This is Matsarya? a form of jealousy. If a man superimposes evil alities on a virtuous man who is endowed with good alities? this is Asuya. If his heart burns when he sees a wealthy or prosperous man? this is Irshya.",
        "PurPort": "A demoniac person, being always against God’s supremacy, does not like to\nbelieve in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and the existence\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called prestige\nand his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the\npresent life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is actually\nenvious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on other\nbodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the\nPersonality of Godhead, because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the\nscriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false\narguments against the existence of God and denies the scriptural authority. He\nthinks himself independent and powerful in every action. He thinks that since\nno one can equal him in strength, power or wealth, he can act in any way and\nno one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of\nhis sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power."

If one understands Kåñëa from the\nBhagavad-gétä and becomes situated in Kåñëa consciousness, engaging himself\nin devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge\noffered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu made this process\nvery easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa\nKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare and to\nengage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff\noffered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional\nactivities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has\ncome to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are\nnot in Kåñëa consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what\nis to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of\nthe Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called\nfollowing the principles of çästra, or scripture. Çästra is without the four.\nprincipal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the\npropensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of\nbeing illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one\nfrom putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations\nas described in the çästra—being above these defects—are accepted without\nalteration by all great saints, äcäryas and great souls.\nIn India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally\nclassified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however,\nlead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the\nprinciples of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional\nstage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the çästras is\nconsidered fortunate.\nIn human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest\noffense of human life. Therefore, mäyä, the material energy of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the\nthreefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of\nmaterial nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness\nbefore the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without\nraising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in\nignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the\nmodes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and\nderide the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They\ndisobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the\nregulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional\nservice, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of\nelevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the\ndemoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and\nbona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the\nhigher stage, then one’s life becomes successful.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures."

Is it possible for them to be\nsituated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional\nstage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures\nbut who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men\nattain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to Kåñëa."

Faith assumes a threefold aspect under the influence of the three alities. When Sattva is strongly developed? when there is a preponderance of Sattva or purity in a man? it is easy for him to attain Selfrealisation or the knowledge of the Self. If Rajas is predominant? the faith becomes the handmaid of activity. If Tamas or inertia prevails? faith is annihilated.Those who are endowed with Sattvic faith aim at the attainment of liberation. Those who are endowed with Rajasic faith run after inferior duties or worldly activities. Those whose faith is Tamasic are cruel. They kill animals for sacrifice. They invoke the spirits and talk with ghosts. When faith is joined to Sattva? it leads to salvation. When Rajas preponderates? it colours the faith and leads to various activities. When Tamas predominates? the faith results in darkness.Faith acires different alities when it is in company with the mind of man. Mind is a thing of many colours. Just as the water of the Ganga is contaminated by being put in a vessel where lior had been kept? so also a virtuous person is spoiled by bad company or constant association with evil persons. The three Gunas or attributes colour the faith of a man. The mind of a man is governed by the preponderating attribute or ality which manifests itself when the other two alities are suppressed. Faith takes a threefold aspect in accordance with the inherent nature or tendencies of the man. The inclinations of men are moulded according to their ality or inherent nature born of their past Samskaras.As is the tendency? so is the desire as is the desire? so is the action as is the action? so is the birth into another being after death. The body is like the seed of the tree? a perpetual chain. Seed perishes in developing into a tree and the tree again produces the seed. This process or cycle continues eternally. Even so man takes a body? does actions? develops tendencies? dies and puts,on a new body in accordance with the nature or tendencies. This continues till he gets knowledge of the Self by transcending the three Gunas? when ignorance? the root cause of birth and death? is destroyed.Faith is born of the individual nature? i.e.? the Samskaras or the latent impressions of virtuous and vicious actions which were performed in the past births and which manifested themselves at the time of death. In the subconscious mind or the Chitta there is a reservoir of past impressions which are revived through the operation of memory.Sattvic Faith in the worship of gods? which is an effect of Sattva.Rajasic Faith in the worship of the Yakshas and Rakshasas? which is an effect of Rajas.Tamasic Faith in the worship of the disembodied spirits and ghosts? which is an effect of Tamas.Faith is the main support of life. It is not mere intellectual belief or blind acceptance of pet dogmas or doctrines. You must understand clearly its characteristics? just as you recognise a tree from the fruits? the mind of a man from his speech? and the actions of previous birth from worldly pleasures and pains.Svabhavaja Inherent in their nature born of past Samskaras.Tam Of it? referring to the threefold faith.",
        "PurPort": "Those who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures but out of\nlaziness or indolence give up following these rules and regulations are\ngoverned by the modes of material nature. According to their previous\nactivities in the mode of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature\nwhich is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the\ndifferent modes of nature has been going on perpetually; since the living entity\nis in contact with material nature, he acquires different types of mentality\naccording to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be\nchanged if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his\nrules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from\nignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that\nblind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become\nelevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with\nintelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can\nchange his position to a higher mode of nature"

        "PurPort": "Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his\nfaith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has\nacquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with\ncertain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the\nFifteenth Chapter, is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme\nLord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material\nnature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life,.\nhe generates his own position by association with the different varieties of\nmaterial nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material.\nAlthough one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of\nlife, originally he is nirguëa, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become\ncleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain\nhis relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without\nfear: Kåñëa consciousness. If one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, then that\npath is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not\ntake to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the\ninfluence of the modes of nature.\nThe word çraddhä, or “faith,” is very significant in this verse. Çraddhä, or\nfaith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One’s faith may be in a\ndemigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One’s strong faith is\nsupposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material\nconditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are\nnot in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness\none can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nAs long as one’s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is\nsubject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The\ncontaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore\naccording to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of\nmaterial nature, one’s faith is established. It should be understood that if one’s\nheart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his\nheart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if\nhis heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus\ncontaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there\nare different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real\nprinciple of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but\nbecause the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus\naccording to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship."

        "PurPort": "In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds\nof worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural\ninjunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those\nwho are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions\nworship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of\nmaterial nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the\ndemigods. The demigods include Brahmä, Çiva and others such as Indra,\nCandra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness\nworship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are\nin the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second.\nWorld War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he\nhad amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market.\nSimilarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a\npowerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God\nand that the same results will be obtained.\nNow, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion\nworship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in\ndarkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some\ndead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness.\nSimilarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have\nseen that in India the lower-class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they\nhave knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer\nsacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God\nworship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In\nthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam (4.3.23) it is said, sattvaà viçuddhaà\nvasudeva-çabditam: “When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships\nVäsudeva.” The purport is that those who are completely purified of the\nmaterial modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThe impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and\nthey worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Viñëu form\nin the material world, which is known as philosophized Viñëu. Viñëu is the\nexpansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists,\nbecause they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nimagine that the Viñëu form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman;\nsimilarly, they imagine that Lord Brahmä is the impersonal form in the\nmaterial mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that\nare worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal\nBrahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In\nconclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be\npurified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature."

        "PurPort": "The purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and\naid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities\nselected those foods that best aid health and increase life’s duration, such as\nmilk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very\ndear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn\nand molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant\nwhen mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness.\nAll these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable\nthings like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have\nno connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in\nthe form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese\nand similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the\nkilling of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this\nkilling goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk.\nSlaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split\npeas, däl, whole wheat, etc.\nFoods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or\noverly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the\nstomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are\nessentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours\nbefore it is eaten (except prasädam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to\nbe in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a\nbad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the\nmode of goodness.\nRemnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was\nfirst offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially\nthe spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in.\nthe mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs,\nalthough very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked\nnor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the\nremnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In\nBhagavad-gétä the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of\nvegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patraà puñpaà phalaà\ntoyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the prasädam\nshould be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunctions\nof the scripture and offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be\ntaken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental.\nTherefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one\nshould offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Though Vidura was a Sudra he was a sage. That is the reason why the Lord has made a separate mention of the wise.Brahmacharya means control but not suppression of the sexdesire or sexforce. If the mind is filled with sublime thoughts by meditation? Japa (repetition of a Mantra)? prayer? study of holy scriptures? eniry of Who am I? and contemplation of the sexless? pure Self? the sexdesire will be devitalised by the withdrawal of the mind. The mind also will be thinned out. Suppressed sexdesire will attack you again and again and will produce wetdreams? irritability and restlessness of the mind. The mind should be rendered pure by meditation? Japa? singing of the Lords names? and prayer. The mind should be controlled first. Then it will be easy for you to control the senses. That is the reason why the practice of Sama or the control of the mind comes first and then comes Dama or the restraint of the senses (in the order of the sixfold virtues. The senses cannot operate without the help of the mind. So the effective remedy for lust and the best aid to celibacy is to control the mind first and then the senses.Intense musing on the objects of the senses does more harm to the inner spiritual life than actual sensegratification. If the mind is not rendered pure by Sadhana? mere mortification of the external senses will not produce the desired effect. Although the external senses are mortified? their internal counterparts which are still energetic and vigorous? revenge upon the mind? and produce intense mental disturbance and wild imagination.To control the mind is diffcult for neophytes or the beginners. It will be extremely difficult to control the mind first when the senses are allowed to run riot. That is the reason why Lord Krishna says Therefore? O Arjuna? mastering first the senses? do thou slay this thing of sin (desire)? destructive of wisdom and knowledge. (Cf.III.41)The theory or doctrine that the mind should be controlled first is ite correct. This practice is intended for the firstclass type of spiritual aspirants. The middling type of students should control the senses first. The senses always have an outgoing tendency. The mind operates through the senses. Control of the one goes hand in hand with control of the other. Control of the senses is also control of the mind? because the mind is a bundle of senses only there is no mind without the senses.Just as an enemy can be easily conered if you have a twopronged attack? so also the mind can be controlled easily if you attack it on two fronts simultaneously -- an external attack on the senses and an internal attack on the mind itself by the eradication of the desires.To say? Control the mind first? you can control the senses (which is one point of view) or Control the senses first? you can control the mind easily (which is another point of view) is simply arguing in a vicious circle like Which came first -- the tree or the seed or You will get the knowledge of the Self if you control all desires -- and you can control all the desires only if you have knowledge of the Self.You need not worry yourself over this seeming paradox. Try to do either of the practices? viz.? control of the mind or control of the senses? according to your liking? capacity? taste and temperament. You can yourself find out by actual practice which is better. As you advance in your practice your doubtwill gradually disapperar and you will enjoy supreme peace and joy.",

The best\ntraining for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from Kåñëa\nconsciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one’s nature\nis to become Kåñëa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by\ntaking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think\nof sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age\nwe unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense\ngratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind’s becoming satisfied.\nThe best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of\nsatisfying stories, as in the Puräëas and the Mahäbhärata. One can take\nadvantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be\ndevoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means\nthat one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in Kåñëa\nconsciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind\nmeans detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be\nstraightforward in his dealings and thereby purify his existence. All these\nqualities together constitute austerity in mental activities."

Om is the Akshara Brahman. Tat means Thath? the indefinable. Sat means Reality.Para Brahman? that Supreme Being? the abiding place of all that lives and moves? is beyond name and class.

Men who are troubled by the afflictions of this world run to the Deity for refuge and call Him by the name. When Brahman is invoked through the name that which is hidden is revealed to the aspirant.These three words have a divine power of their own. The vibrations that they produce in one are such as to arouse the latent divinity and also to secure the necessary response from the Cosmic Being Whom they connote.When a sacrificial rite or the like is found defective? it will be rendered perfect by the utterance of the powerful Mantra Om Tat Sat or one of the three designations in the end.

If the doer of sacrifices remembers either of these Mantras all obstacles that stand in the way of success of the sacrifices are removed.Om Tat Sat has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman in the Vedanta by the knowers of Brahman.

Then He created the Brahmanas? gave them the Vedas to be their guide and directed them to perform sacrifices and other rites.Puraa Of old At the beginning of creation by the Prajapati.Brahman here means the Veda.",
        "PurPort": "It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided\ninto three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But\nwhether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned,\ncontaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the\nSupreme—oà tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they\nbecome means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an\nobjective is indicated. These three words, oà tat sat, particularly indicate the\nAbsolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the\nword oà is always found.\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not\nattain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the\nultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity,\nsacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the\nmode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three\nwords oà tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme\nLord, e.g., oà tad viñëoù. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the\nSupreme Lord is uttered, oà is added. This is the indication of Vedic\nliterature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Oà ity etad\nbrahmaëo nediñöhaà näma (Åg Veda) indicates the first goal. Then tat tvam asi\n(Chändogya Upaniñad 6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya\n(Chändogya Upaniñad 6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become\noà tat sat. Formerly when Brahmä, the first created living entity, performed\nsacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic.\nsuccession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-gétä recommends,\ntherefore, that any work done should be done for oà tat sat, or for the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and\nsacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa\nconsciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which\nenables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in\nacting in such a transcendental way"

Although there is a\nprocess of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes\ndirectly to Kåñëa consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended\nin this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper.\nspiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can\nachieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is\ncalled love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One\nshould therefore take to Kåñëa consciousness directly.

In every chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa stresses that devotional\nservice unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life.\nThis same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most\nconfidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to\ndevotional service: yoginäm api sarveñäà. .. “Of all yogés or transcendentalists,\none who always thinks of Me within himself is best.” In the next six chapters,\npure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third\nsix chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and\ntranscendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was\nconcluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme\nLord, represented by the words oà tat sat, which indicate Viñëu, the Supreme\nPerson. The third part of Bhagavad-gétä has shown that devotional service, and\nnothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing\npast äcäryas and the Brahma-sütra, the Vedänta-sütra. Certain impersonalists\nconsider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of Vedänta-sütra,\nbut actually the Vedänta-sütra is meant for understanding devotional service,\nfor the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vedänta-sütra and He is its\nknower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every\nVeda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä.\nAs in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was\ndescribed, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is.\ngiven. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of\nthe transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna\nwants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-gétä, namely\nrenunciation (tyäga) and the renounced order of life (sannyäsa). Thus he is\nasking the meaning of these two words.\nTwo words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord—Håñékeça and\nKeçé-niñüdana—are significant. Håñékeça is Kåñëa, the master of all senses, who\ncan always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize\neverything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some\ndoubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses\nKåñëa as Keçé-niñüdana. Keçé was a most formidable demon who was killed by\nthe Lord; now Arjuna is expecting Kåñëa to kill the demon of doubt"

Even these refers to acts of sacrifice? charity and austerity. Actions that are performed in an unselfish spirit without attachment and idea of agency? do not stand in the way of your obtaining emancipation. When actions are done without expectation of rewards? Rajas and Tamas are destroyed and the mind is filled with Sattva or purity. Actions done with the spirit of selflessness and with discrimination are instrumental in destroying the bonds of Karma (the law of cause and effect).The Lord said Hear from Me the conclusion or the final truth about renunciation (verse 4 above). Then He said with all the force of His authority that acts of sacrifice? charity and austerity should not be given up as they are purifiers of the wise. Even these actions should be performed? etc.? is only the conclusion of what the Lord has stated in verse 4.The word Api (even) implies that the acts of sacrifice? charity and austerity should be done by an aspirant although they bind one who has attachment to the actions and a desire for their reward.Just as the seeds of trees can be rendered barren by being scorched? so the aspirant burns the fruitbearing tendency of Karma through the abandonment of the desire for the reward.",

In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material\nadvancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one’s\nexistence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped.\nEverything that leads to Kåñëa consciousness must be encouraged. In the\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional\nservice to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of\nreligion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice or\ncharity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord."

Samsaya Bhavana (doubt)? Asambhavana (improbability) and Viparitabhavana (perversion)? and by the practice of the four means and service of the Guru (who is versed in the scriptures and established in Brahman) and hearing the truths from him.Such a Medhavi will not think that prohibited actions which bind an ignorant man will be unfavourable to him. He will never think that they will bind him if he has to perform them? because he is above good and evil? virtue and vice? right and wrong. He has no idea of agency (Kartritva Abhimana) he feels that he is a Kritakritya? one who has accomplished all actions.This does not mean that he will do wrong actions.

He recognises that the happenings of life are inevitable. He acts in a variety of ways but is not disturbed as he has a balanced and disciplined mind.There must be no hatred for unpleasant or disagreeable action that brings physical suffering? danger or unlucky results or untoward conseences? when it is the work that should be done. You will have to accept such work also with a willing heart and work with hear and soul. You must have a profound and comprehensive understanding of its need and meaning also. Arjuna failed to understand in the beginning the deep significance and need of the work given by the Lord. He brought in his own foolish philosophy.

The soul within the body is acting\nto bring about the results of activity and is therefore known as kartä, “the\ndoer.” That the soul is the knower and the doer is stated in the çruti. Eña hi\ndrañöä srañöä (Praçna Upaniñad 4.9). It is also confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra\nby the verses jïo ’ta eva (2.3.18) and kartä çästrärthavattvät (2.3.33). The\ninstruments of action are the senses, and by the senses the soul acts in various\nways. For each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one’s\nactivities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart\nas a friend. The Supreme Lord is the supercause. Under these circumstances,\nhe who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul\nsituated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in\ncomplete Kåñëa consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions.\nEverything is dependent on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead."

He is unattached like ether. He is always the silent witness. He is the spectator of activity. The egoistic man of little understanding only thinks that he is the real agent? and so he is bound by actions. He takes birth again and again to reap the fruits of his actions. For him who considers the body as consciousness? God or the Self? it naturally follows that the Self is the agent or the doer. He who identifies himself with the body? who has taken the body as the pure Self? has cast a net over himself? and he leads a deluded life of utter ignorance. He is bound by the fetters or bonds of Karma. He is ever shut up in the prisonhouse of this body.He who has not united himself with the Buddhi? who has got an impure or untrained understanding? who regards the Self as the actor or the agent is certainly a man of perverted intelligence. He is deluded. He is really a blind man. He sees not though he has eyes. He does not behold the essence of things. He has no idea of the supreme Principle (the Self) Which is Itself actionless? Which ever stands as a silent witness of the activities of all minds and all organs of all beings? Which moves the minds? organs and the lifeforce and the bodies to action? just as the magnet makes the iron pieces move.

He does not understand anything. He has no knowledge of the,actionless? pure? selfluminous Self.The ignorant man of untrained understanding identifies himself with the five causes and regards the pure actionless Self as the agent or doer of the actions which are really done by these five causes. What is the reason for this Why does he regard them so Because he is not endowed with a pure and subtle intellect his understanding (Buddhi) has not been trained in the practice of Vedanta he is not eipped with the four means of salvation his intellect has not been trained by the teachings of the preceptor or the spiritual teacher in the methods of logical reasoning.He who considers that the pure actionless Self is the agent or the doer is certainly a man of untrained understanding. He has no knowledge of the actionless Self and action. Therefore? he is a man of perverted intelligence. His intellect works or moves in the wrong direction. His intellect moves in the sensual grooves or avenues. It runs like the vicious horse and leads to birth and death. The technie of Buddhi Yoga taught in the Gita enables one effectively to prevent this.He does not perceive or cognise the Truth though he has eyes. Though he sees? he sees the external? gross? illusory? everchanging? perishable objects only. He does not behold the one immortal? unchanging? allblissful essence? which is the basis or substratum of everything. He is like the man with jaundiced eyes? who sees all objects tinged with yellow colur? or like the man suffering from diplopia who beholds many moons? or like the man who thinks that the moon moves when the clouds move? or like the man who? seated in a train? imagines that the trees are moving when it is the train that is really moving.

O Arjuna? the characterisitics of the man who has transcended activity? and who has gone beyond the bonds of Karma.When selfishnes and egoism are destroyed? when desire and personal gain are renounced? actions cannot bind a man. He knows that the Self is not destroyed when the body perishes. He has no idea of agency. The act of killing itself? in his case? becomes one necessary for the peace and harmony of the world. His killing without desire is like the killing of a murderer by the executioner and the judge on behalf of the community for the preservation of peace and harmony in the world.He who has a trained intellect? pure understanding and developed reason? who has a knowledge of the scriptures? who has devoted himself to the study of the scriptures? who is eipped with the knowledge of logic? who is well trained by the instructions of his preceptor? is absolutely free from the egoistic notion that I am the agent or the doer. He knows perfectly well that Nature or Guna or ones own nature does everything. He thus thinks I am the silent witness of all activities. I am not the doer. These five (the body? the actor? etc.) which are superimposed on the pure? actionless Self through ignorance are the causes of all actions. I do not do anything. The senses move amongst the senseobjects. The alities (Gunas) move in their counterparts in the senses which are also the products of the Gunas. I know the essence of the divisions of the alities and their functions. I am in essence without limbs. How can action or work be ascribed to me I am without hands? without legs? without feet? without breath and without mind. I am ever pure? spotless and immovable and immutable. He will never repent thus I have done a wrong action. I ought to have done like this. I have done an evil action. I will go to hell. He is always wise. He can,never do a wrong action. His will has become one with the cosmic will. His will has become blended with the will of the Lord. Whatever he does is done by the Lord only. He has no will of his own. He sees rightly. Though he kills? he does not commit the act of killing. He is not bound by the fruit of a vicious action as an effect of that act. He is beyond good and evil? beyond the pairs of opposites? as he has knowledge of the Self.An objector says The statement that though he kills these people? he does not kill? is selfcontradictory.We say This objection is really not tenable. From the worldly point of view the Lord says though he kills? because man identifies the Self with the body? etc.? and thinks I am the killer. From the transcendental point of view explained above? the Lord says? He kills not? he is not bound.Another objector says The Self acts in conjunction with the body? etc.? -- He who looks upon his Self Which is isolated? as the agent৷৷.  (XVIII.16)We say This objection also cannot stand. As the omnipresent ether is not affected by reason of its subtlety? even so the Self? seated everywhere in the body? is not affected. This immortal? immutable? changeless? formless? attributeless Self? though seated in the body? does not act and is not affected? just as the crystal is not affected by the red colour of the flower that comes into contact with it? just as the sun is not affected by the diseases of the eye. A thing that changes only can join with others and become the agent. The Self is always isolated? independent and free. This Self is immutable (II.25). The alities move amidst the alities (III.28). Though seated in the body? He does not act (XIII.31). Actions are wrought by the alities (III.27). You will find in the Brihadaranyaka were. By reasoning also we may establish the same conclusion thusThe Self is indivisible? allpervading? infinite? limbless? without parts? independent? ever free and immutable. Therefore the actions of the body can never be ascribed to the agency of the Self.Verily the actions of one cannot go to another who has not done them. Just as blue colour cannot belong to the sky? silver to the motherofpearl? water to mirage? so also what is ascribed to the Self by ignorance cannot really belong to It. The changes that occur in the body pertain to the body but not to the pure actionless Self which is always the spectator or the silent witness. Therefore? it is right to say that the wise man who is free from egoism and all impurities of the mind? neither kills nor is he bound though he kills.In chapter II.19? the Lord stated the proposition -- He slayeth not? nor is he slain. In chapter II.20? He said The Self is unborn? eternal? ancient the Self is not slain when the body is killed. The Lord has touched here and there that the Self is not affected by works? that there is no necessity for the wise man of doing actions. He concludes that the sage kills not? nor is he bound? and sums up the teaching of the Gita. The teaching of the Gita has been concluded in this verse. The Sannyasins who are free from egoism are not affected by Karma. The threefold fruits of action? viz.? evil? good and mixed (see verse 12 above) do not accrue to them. Those worldlyminded persons who work with egoism and expectation of fruits are tainted by the works. They are forced to experience the fruits of their actions and to take birth again and again. (Cf.II.19V.7)",
        "PurPort": "In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises\nfrom false ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not\nconsider the supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a\nsupersanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instruments\nof work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme\nsanctioner is perfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion.\nPersonal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a\nlack of Kåñëa consciousness. Anyone who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness\nunder the direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\neven though killing, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected by the reaction of\nsuch killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he\nis not subject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account,\nthen he is certainly judged by a court of law"

Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is\ncalled inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle\nform of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the\npsychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called\nimpetus. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or\nfrom the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and\nthe worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses,\nincluding the mind, which is the center of all the senses.

Some regard that Isvara is a mere piece of stone or wood. Such knowledge is really not based on reason. It does not see things in their true light. It is narrow (Alpam) as it is not founded on reason. It produces very small results too. It extends over a limited area and is not allcomprehensive. This knowledge is said to be Tamasic? as it is found in Tamasic persons who are devoid of the power of discrimination.",
        "PurPort": "The “knowledge” of the common man is always in the mode of darkness or\nignorance because every living entity in conditional life is born into the mode\nof ignorance. One who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or\nscriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the body. He is not\nconcerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture. For him God is\nmoney, and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands. Such\nknowledge has no connection with the Absolute Truth. It is more or less like\nthe knowledge of the ordinary animals: the knowledge of eating, sleeping,\ndefending and mating. Such knowledge is described here as the product of the\nmode of darkness. In other words, knowledge concerning the spirit soul beyond\nthis body is called knowledge in the mode of goodness, knowledge producing\nmany theories and doctrines by dint of mundane logic and mental speculation\nis the product of the mode of passion, and knowledge concerned only with\nkeeping the body comfortable is said to be in the mode of ignorance."

Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His\nenergies. Generally the Vaiñëava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His\ninternal energy.

He who has no knowledge of the Self cannot remain even for a moment without doing action. (Cf.III.35)",
        "PurPort": "One’s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-gétä. As already discussed\nin previous verses, the duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra are\nprescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not\nimitate another’s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work\ndone by çüdras should not artificially claim to be a brähmaëa, although he may\nhave been born into a brähmaëa family. In this way one should work according\nto his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the\nSupreme Lord. The occupational duty of a brähmaëa is certainly in the mode\nof goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should\nnot imitate the occupational duty of a brähmaëa. For a kñatriya, or\nadministrator, there are so many abominable things; a kñatriya has to be\nviolent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a kñatriya has to tell lies for the sake\nof diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a\nkñatriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the\nduties of a brähmaëa.\nOne should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a\nkñatriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is\nperformed for the sake of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there\nneed be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a\nmerchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there\ncan be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, “Oh, my dear customer, for you I\nam making no profit,” but one should know that without profit the merchant\ncannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says\nthat he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because\nhe is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he\nshould give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brähmaëa. That is.\nnot recommended. Whether one is a kñatriya, a vaiçya, or a çüdra doesn’t\nmatter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even\nbrähmaëas, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill\nanimals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies.\nSimilarly, if a kñatriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is\nno sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and\nelaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yajïa, or for\nViñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense\ngratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be\nengaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he\nshould decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord."

It is not possible for any man who has no knowledge of the Self to relinish action totally therefore he should not abandon action.",
        "PurPort": "In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of\nnature. Even if one is a brähmaëa, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal\nkilling is necessary. Similarly, a kñatriya, however pious he may be, has to fight\nenemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be,\nmust sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to\ndo business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid\nthem. Similarly, even though a man is a çüdra serving a bad master, he has to\ncarry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite\nthese flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are\nborn out of his own nature.\nA very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is\nsmoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke\nin the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers\nto give up the work of a kñatriya and take up the occupation of a brähmaëa, he\nis not assured that in the occupation of a brähmaëa there are no unpleasant\nduties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be\ncompletely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of\nfire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one\ntakes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts\nof the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing\nconditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because\nthere are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve\nthe Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the\nperfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation\nare purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with\ndevotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is\nself-realization"

It is not attracted by the sensual objects of the world. It is filled with dispassion and discrimination.He gradually gets himself established in his own Self which is of the nature of ExistenceKnowledgeBliss. Such a person who has knowledge of the Self attains to the highest perfection? to pefect freedom from action by renunciation.Ignorance is destroyed by the attainment of the knowledge of the Self. There is cessation of activity. One may perform actions for the solidarity of the world and yet he will not be bound by actions as he has attained absolute freedom from action through the knowledge of the Self.

He has no idea of agency as he is absolutely free from egoism? as he has identified himself with the Supreme Being.Naishkarmya siddhi may also mean the attainment of the state of Naishkarmya. In this exalted? magnanimous? ineffable state of divine splendour and glory? one remains as the actionless Self. This is the state of immediate liberation of the Vedantins (Kaivalya Moksha or Sadyomukti). This marvellous state is attained by renunciation or right knowledge or by the renunciation of all actions brought about by the attainment of the knowledge of the Self. Mentally renouncing all actions and selfcontrolled? the embodied one rests happily in the ninegated? city? neither acting nor causing others to act. (Cf.V.13)Now the Lord teaches in the next verse how a man who? having attained perfection as described above in verse 46? by doing his duty in the service of the Lord can attain perfect freedom from action. He gets discrimination? practises constant meditation and rests in the knowledge of the immutable Self.,(Cf.III.4and19)",
        "PurPort": "Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and\nparcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore think that he has no right to enjoy\nthe results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the\nresults of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually\nKåñëa consciousness. The person acting in Kåñëa consciousness is really a\nsannyäsé, one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is\nsatisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached\nto anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in\nanything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the\nLord. A sannyäsé is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities,.\nbut a person who is in Kåñëa consciousness automatically attains this\nperfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This\nstate of mind is called yogärüòha, or the perfectional stage of yoga.

The spiritual vibrations in solitude are wonderfully elevating. Meditation will come by itself without exertion. All saints and sages who have attained Selfrealisation have remained in solitude for a number of years. You will have good meditation if you sit on the bank of a river? in a cave or on the seashore or in a jungle. During the Christmas and Easter holidays you can all enjoy the peace of solitude. It is very necessary to live in solitude at least for a month or a fortnight in a year for the householders. Instead of wasting time? energy and money in Calcutta or any other city? during the holidays? live in holy places like Rishikesh? Uttarakasi or Naimisaranya drink the nectar of peace in such places by doing Anushthana (intense and systematic spiritual practice) or Japa of a Mantra and attain immortality. If you once taste the bliss of solitude you will never forget it. Every year you will attempt to taste it again. He who takes too much food (a glutton) is ite unfit for meditation or the spiritual path. Too much food will produce laziness? a halfsleepy state and deep sleep also. Eat to live. Eat in moderation. You will have a light body and light? cheerful and serene mind. This will help you in your practice of meditation. Observe Mauna or the vow of silelnce for a week or a month. Observe the vow for two hours daily. Control the body. Practise Ahimsa and Brahmacharya. Meditate on the Self or on the Lord Hari with four hands? or on Lord Krishna? Rama or Siva. Be regular in your meditation and gradually increase the period of meditation from 15 minutes to 3 or 6 hours at a sitting. If you are a wholetimed aspirant? spend the whole time in meditation. If you are not able to do this? do Likhita Japa (writing the Mantra) and Kirtan (singing the Names and glories of the Lord). Study religious books in the interval. Only advanced aspirants can meditate for a long time. Watch the mind and cultivate dispassion. Energy will leak out through the senses if you are careless and nonvigilant. If energy leaks out? you cannot have good meditation. Dispassion is indifference to sensual enjoyments herein and hereafter? absence of desire for visible and invisible objects. You must have steady? lasting and sustained dispassion. It should not wane. It should be a constant attitude of the mind. You must be fully established in dispassion.In doing the Anushthana for 40 days live on milk and fruits or light diet. Take only 3 or 4 articles of food. Take one meal only. Sleep on the floor. Observe celibacy and the vow of silence. Do not come out of the room. Speak little if you do not observe perfect silence. Do the Anushthana on the banks of the Ganga or any sacred river. Try to do one or several Purascharanas of your Ishta Mantra. If there are five letters (syllables in English) in the Mantra? 500?000 repetitions of the Mantra will constitute one Purascharana.",

This means\nthat one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is\nalready in a state of liberation, called brahma-bhüta, oneness with the\nAbsolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot\nrender service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference\nbetween the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher\nspiritual sense.\nIn the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification,\nthere is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure\ndevotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in Kåñëa consciousness has\nnothing for which to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is\nengaged in God’s service, in Kåñëa consciousness, becomes also full in himself.\nHe is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no\nthought other than Kåñëa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for\nany material loss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord.\nHe has no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living\nentity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore\neternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher\nand someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee\nhas nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him\nstone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bhüta stage, and this stage\nis attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea\nof becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one’s\nindividuality becomes hellish, the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom\nbecomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like serpents’ teeth that are.\nbroken.

O Arjuna? who has attained to union with Me through singleminded and unflinching devotion is verily My very Self. Devotion culminates in knowledge. Devotion begins with two and ends in one. ParaBhakti (supreme devotion) and Jnana are one. Devotion is the mother. Knowledge is the son.

Knowing is attaining Selfknowledge. To know That is to become That. Entering is knowing or beoming That. Entering is the attainment of Selfknowledge or Selfrealisation. These are all jugglery of words only. Knowing and entering are synonymous terms. It is very difficult to understand or comprehend transcendental spiritual matters. The teachers use various terms or expressions? analogies? similes? parables? stories? etc. to make the aspirant grasp the matter clearly and lucidly. Words are imperfect and languages are defective. They cannot fully express the inner spiritual experiences. The teacher somehow or other expresses to the students or aspirants these spiritual ideas. The aspirant himself will have to realise the Self. That is beyond the reach of words of expressions or analogies of similes. How can there be similes for that nondual Brahman These words are a sort of help or prop for the aspirants to lean upon in the beginning to understand spiritual matters. When he realises the Self? these words are of no value to him. He himself becomes an embodiment of knowledge.",
        "PurPort": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and His plenary portions.\ncannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If\nanyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to\ntake to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee.\nOtherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be\nhidden. As already stated in Bhagavad-gétä (7.25), nähaà prakäçaù sarvasya:\nHe is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite\nscholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in Kåñëa\nconsciousness and devotional service can understand what Kåñëa is.\nUniversity degrees are not helpful.\nOne who is fully conversant with the Kåñëa science becomes eligible to\nenter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kåñëa. Becoming Brahman does\nnot mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as\ndevotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of\ndevotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation.\nLiberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual\nlife the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure\nKåñëa consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the word viçate,\n“enters into Me,” supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous\nwith the impersonal Brahman. No. Viçate means that one can enter into the\nabode of the Supreme Lord in one’s individuality to engage in His association\nand render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not\nto become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. impersonalists\ngenerally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This\nmay be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps\nhis personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living\nentities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean\nis not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in\nthe ocean depths.\nBecause of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the\ntranscendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it\nis stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one\nunderstand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom\nAfter attainment of the brahma-bhüta stage of freedom from material\nconceptions, devotional service begins by one’s hearing about the Lord. When\none hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhüta stage\ndevelops, and material contamination—greediness and lust for sense\nenjoyment—disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a\ndevotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such\nattachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life\nhe can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam also. After liberation the process of bhakti, or\ntranscendental service, continues. The Vedänta-sütra (4.1.12) confirms this:\nä-präyaëät taträpi hi dåñöam. This means that after liberation the process of\ndevotional service continues. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, real devotional\nliberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own\nidentity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already\nexplained: every living entity is a part-and-parcel fragmental portion of the\nSupreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After\nliberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from\nmisconceptions of life."

The Sanskrit word mat-paraù is very important in this verse. It indicates\nthat one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just\nto satisfy Kåñëa. And while working in that way, one should think of Kåñëa\nonly: “I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.” While\nacting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect Kåñëa\nconsciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something\nwhimsically he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of\nduty is not in the devotional service of Kåñëa consciousness. One should act\naccording to the order of Kåñëa. This is a very important point. That order of\nKåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.\nTherefore the spiritual master’s order should be taken as the prime duty of life.\nIf one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then\none’s perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed."

For one who acts in Kåñëa consciousness, Lord Kåñëa becomes\nthe most intimate friend. He always looks after His friend’s comfort, and He\ngives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four\nhours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by\nthe false ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself\nindependent of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under.\nstrict material laws. But as soon as he acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he is\nliberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully\nthat one who is not active in Kåñëa consciousness is losing himself in the\nmaterial whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul\nactually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who\nacts in Kåñëa consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by\nKåñëa from within and confirmed by the spiritual master."

Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that Arjuna should\ngive up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply\nsurrender to Kåñëa. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful\nreactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.\nIn the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from\nall sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Kåñëa. Thus one may think\nthat unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the\nsurrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free\nfrom all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Çré Kåñëa he\nis automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from\nsinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Kåñëa as the supreme savior.\nof all living entities.

One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his\nposition in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to\nthe point of Kåñëa consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that\ndoes not lead to the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness should be\navoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances Kåñëa will protect\nhim from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the\nbody and soul together. Kåñëa will see to that. One should always think himself\nhelpless and should consider Kåñëa the only basis for his progress in life. As\nsoon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full\nKåñëa consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of\nmaterial nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory\nprocesses by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system,\netc., but one who surrenders unto Kåñëa does not have to execute so many\nmethods. That simple surrender unto Kåñëa will save him from unnecessarily\nwasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all\nsinful reactions.\nOne should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Kåñëa. His name is Kåñëa\nbecause He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful,\nall-powerful, omnipotent vision of Kåñëa is fortunate. There are different\nkinds of transcendentalists—some of them are attached to the impersonal\nBrahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but\none who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead as Kåñëa Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other\nwords, devotional service to Kåñëa, in full consciousness, is the most\nconfidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole\nBhagavad-gétä. Karma-yogés, empiric philosophers, mystics and devotees are all\ncalled transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The\nparticular words used here, mä çucaù, “Don’t fear, don’t hesitate, don’t worry,”\nare very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds\nof religious forms and simply surrender unto Kåñëa, but such worry is useless."

        "PurPort": "The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that\nhe has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for\nself-discipline. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says that the actual position of the\nliving entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this\nprinciple, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in\nserving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living\nentity’s constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the\nillusory mäyä or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his\nnormal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then\ncertainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this\nmaterial world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as\nthe master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his\nillusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act\naccording to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of mäyä to trap the\nliving entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he\nis no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does\nnot think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does\nnot consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from\nthe illusory energy is to understand Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, and agree to act according to His order.\nThe word moha is very important in this verse. Moha refers to that which is\nopposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that.\nevery living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking\noneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that\nhe is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material\nnature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the\nLord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees\nto act in Kåñëa consciousness.\nKåñëa consciousness is acting according to Kåñëa’s order. A conditioned\nsoul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the\nSupreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor\nof everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is\nthe friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the\ncontroller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the\ncontroller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all\npotencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the\ndevotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does\nnot become a devotee, but a servitor of mäyä. Arjuna, however, after hearing\nBhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all\nillusion. He could understand that Kåñëa was not only his friend but the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood Kåñëa factually. So to\nstudy Bhagavad-gétä is to understand Kåñëa factually. When a person is in full\nknowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kåñëa. When Arjuna understood that it\nwas Kåñëa’s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed\nto fight according to Kåñëa’s desire. He again took up his weapons—his arrows\nand bow—to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Yoginäm api sarveñäm.\nNärada is the direct disciple of Kåñëa and the spiritual master of Vyäsa..\nTherefore Vyäsa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic\nsuccession, and Saïjaya is the direct disciple of Vyäsa. Therefore by the grace\nof Vyäsa, Saïjaya’s senses were purified, and he could see and hear Kåñëa\ndirectly. One who directly hears Kåñëa can understand this confidential\nknowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear\nKåñëa; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as\nunderstanding Bhagavad-gétä is concerned.\nIn Bhagavad-gétä, all the yoga systems—karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and\nbhakti-yoga—are explained. Kåñëa is the master of all such mysticism. It is to\nbe understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand\nKåñëa directly, so, by the grace of Vyäsa, Saïjaya was also able to hear Kåñëa\ndirectly. Actually there is no difference between hearing directly from Kåñëa\nand hearing directly from Kåñëa via a bona fide spiritual master like Vyäsa.\nThe spiritual master is the representative of Vyäsadeva also. Therefore,\naccording to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master the\ndisciples conduct the ceremony called Vyäsa-püjä."

This is the transcendental position of spiritual\nlife. In other words, one who hears the Gétä from the right source, directly\nfrom Kåñëa, attains full Kåñëa consciousness. The result of Kåñëa\nconsciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life\nwith a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment."

        "PurPort": "The Bhagavad-gétä began with an inquiry of Dhåtaräñöra’s. He was hopeful\nof the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhéñma, Droëa and\nKarëa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after\ndescribing the scene on the battlefield, Saïjaya told the King, “You are\nthinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kåñëa and Arjuna are\npresent, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhåtaräñöra\ncould not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna\nbecause Kåñëa was there. Kåñëa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for\nArjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kåñëa is full of all opulences,\nand renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such\nrenunciation, for Kåñëa is also the master of renunciation.\nThe fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiñöhira. Arjuna was\nfighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiñöhira. Because Kåñëa and Arjuna\nwere on the side of Yudhiñöhira, Yudhiñöhira’s victory was certain. The battle\nwas to decide who would rule the world, and Saïjaya predicted that the power\nwould be transferred to Yudhiñöhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiñöhira,\nafter gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not\nonly was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never\nspoke a lie during his life.\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gétä to be a\ndiscussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book\ncannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kåñëa incited Arjuna to fight,\nwhich is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated:\nBhagavad-gétä is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction\nof morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse:\nman-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù. One must become a devotee of Kåñëa, and the\nessence of all religion is to surrender unto Kåñëa (sarva-dharmän parityajya.\nmäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja). The instructions of Bhagavad-gétä constitute the\nsupreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be\npurifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the Gétä is\nthe last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Kåñëa. This is the\nverdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\nFrom Bhagavad-gétä we can understand that to realize oneself by\nphilosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully\nsurrender unto Kåñëa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the\nteachings of Bhagavad-gétä. The path of regulative principles according to the\norders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a\nconfidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are\nconfidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more\nconfidential. And surrender unto Kåñëa in devotional service in full Kåñëa\nconsciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the\nEighteenth Chapter.\nAnother feature of Bhagavad-gétä is that the actual truth is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three\nfeatures—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, and ultimately the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute\nTruth means perfect knowledge of Kåñëa. If one understands Kåñëa, then all\nthe departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding.\nKåñëa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal\npotency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into\ntwo classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities\nare innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Kåñëa.\nMaterial energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is\neffected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.\nThis manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and\ninvisible.\nIn Bhagavad-gétä five principal subject matters have been discussed: the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal\ntime and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Kåñëa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth—impersona\nBrahman, localized Paramätmä and any other transcendental\nconception—exist within the category of understanding the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different,\nnothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different\nfrom everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of “inconceivable oneness\nand difference.” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of\nthe Absolute Truth.\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an\natomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kåñëa may be compared to\nthe sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the\nmarginal energy of Kåñëa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with\nthe material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living\nentity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs\nto the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By\nproper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kåñëa.\nThus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\nBhagavad-gétä in the matter of its Conclusion—the Perfection of Renunciation."
